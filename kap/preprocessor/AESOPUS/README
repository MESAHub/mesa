We thank Paola Marigo for providing these tables.

Additional tables can be generated using the webform at

  http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/aesopus


To add a new set of tables:

1) Collect a set of tables for a given reference abundance pattern,
one file per desired reference metallicity.

2) Manually extract the set of relevant values from the AESOPUS files
(logT, logR, reference CNO values, etc.).  These values are assumed to
be the same for each file.  Record these and the list of filenames
from Step 1 in a YAML config file.  See AGSS09.yml for the format.

3) Run the included python script ./aesopus.py <yaml-filename>.

4) This will produce an HDF5 file that can be placed in your MESA work
directory.  In the case where it will be included in MESA by default,
copy it to the kap directory, commit it, and and update
./build_data_and_export.
