MESA Code of Conduct
====================

Code
----

In the interest of fostering a productive and welcoming collaborative
environment, we ask that participants in the MESA project (whether
developers, contributors, or users) commit to the following standards of
behavior:

-  Participants will conduct themselves in a professional manner that is
   welcoming, inclusive, and free from any form of disrespect,
   intimidation, bullying, discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.

-  Participants will treat each other with civility and respect to
   create a collegial and professional environment where all voices and
   perspectives can be heard irrespective of biases, known and unknown.
   Creating an ethical and supportive environment is the responsibility
   of all participants.

-  Participants will avoid taking inappropriate actions or making
   statements based on characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity,
   sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital
   status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status,
   educational background, occupation, seniority or any other
   characteristic protected by law.
