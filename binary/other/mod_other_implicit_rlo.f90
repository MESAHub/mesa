      module mod_other_implicit_rlo

      ! NOTE: remember to set one of these to true:
      ! use_other_check_implicit_rlo_mdot = .true.
      ! use_other_implicit_function_to_solve = .true.
      
! you can add your own routine for use instead of the default ones

! here's how to do it.

! Before doing anything, let's make sure your working copy of run_binary_extras works.
! edit the extras_binary_controls routine 
!      subroutine extras_binary_controls(binary_id, ierr)
!         integer :: binary_id
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!        write(*,*) 'hello from extra_binary_controls'
!      end subroutine extras_binary_controls

! then, in your work directory, do ./mk and ./rn to check that it is okay.
! assuming that worked, now edit extra_binary_controls to set the procedure pointer to other_wind_transfer

!      subroutine extras_binary_controls(binary_id, ierr)
!         integer :: binary_id
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!        b% other_implicit_function_to_solve => my_implicit_function_to_solve
!      end subroutine extras_controls

!      subroutine my_implicit_function_to_solve(binary_id, function_to_solve, use_sum, ierr)
!         use const_def, only: dp
!         integer, intent(in) :: binary_id
!         real(dp), intent(out) :: function_to_solve, ierr
!         logical, intent(out) :: use_sum
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!         function_to_solve = 0d0
!         use_sum = .false.
!      end subroutine my_implicit_function_to_solve
         
      ! NOTE: if you'd like to have some inlist controls for your routine,
      ! you can use the x_ctrl array of real(dp) variables that is in &controls
      ! e.g., in the &controls inlist, you can set
      !     x_ctrl(1) = my_special_param
      ! then in your routine, you can access that by
      !     s% x_ctrl(1)
      ! of course before you can use s, you need to get it using the id argument.
      ! here's an example of how to do that -- add these lines at the start of your routine:
      !
      !         use star_lib, only: star_ptr
      !         type (star_info), pointer :: s
      !         call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
      !         if (ierr /= 0) then ! OOPS
      !            return
      !         end if
      !
      ! To get the binary pointer using the provided binary_id, add these lines.
      !     
      !      type (binary_info), pointer :: b
      !      call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
      !      if (ierr /= 0) then ! failure in  binary_ptr
      !         return
      !      end if
      ! 
      ! for integer control values, you can use x_integer_ctrl
      ! for logical control values, you can use x_logical_ctrl
