      module mod_other_binary_wind_transfer

      ! NOTE: remember to set true:
      ! use_other_binary_wind_transfer = .true.
      
! you can add your own routine for use instead of the default ones

! here's how to do it.

! Before doing anything, let's make sure your working copy of run_binary_extras works.
! edit the extras_binary_controls routine 
!      subroutine extras_binary_controls(binary_id, ierr)
!         integer :: binary_id
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!        write(*,*) 'hello from extra_binary_controls'
!      end subroutine extras_binary_controls

! then, in your work directory, do ./mk and ./rn to check that it is okay.
! assuming that worked, now edit extra_binary_controls to set the procedure pointer to other_wind_transfer

!      subroutine extras_binary_controls(binary_id, ierr)
!         integer :: binary_id
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!        b% other_binary_wind_transfer => wind_transfer_routine
!      end subroutine extras_controls

!      subroutine wind_transfer_routine(binary_id, s_i, ierr)
!         integer, intent(in) :: binary_id, s_i
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!         ! for example, a fixed fraction of the wind
!         b% wind_xfer_fraction(s_i) = 0.5
!      end subroutine wind_transfer_routine

! A more elaborate example for wind transfer is the Wind Roche Lobe Overflow mechanism.
! The implementation of Abate et al. 2013 is:

!       subroutine WRLOF_wind_transfer(binary_id, s_i, ierr)
!         integer, intent(in) :: binary_id, s_i
!         integer, intent(out) :: ierr
!         real(dp) :: r_dust, x, q2, c1, c2, c3
!         type (binary_info), pointer :: b
!         ! Wind roche lobe overflow as implemented by:
!         ! Abate et al. 2013, A&A, 552, A26
!
!         ierr = 0
!         call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
!         if (ierr /= 0) then
!            write(*,*) 'failed in binary_ptr'
!            return
!         end if
!         
!         ! Dust radius based on Hofner 2007, ASPC, 378, 145
!         r_dust = 0.5d0 * b% r(s_i) * (b% s_donor % Teff / 1500d0)**2.5d0
!         x = r_dust / b% rl(s_i)
!         
!         ! constants from Abate et al. eq. 5
!         q2 = ( b% m(3-s_i)/b% m(s_i) )**2d0
!         c1 = -0.284d0
!         c2 = 0.918d0
!         c3 = -0.234d0
!         
!         ! WRLOF transfer fraction from Abate et al. eq. 9
!         b% wind_xfer_fraction(s_i) = 25d0 / 9d0 * q2 * (c1*x**2 + c2*x + c3)
!         
!         b% wind_xfer_fraction(s_i) = min(b% wind_xfer_fraction(s_i), 5d-1)
!       
!      end subroutine WRLOF_wind_transfer
         
      ! NOTE: if you'd like to have some inlist controls for your routine,
      ! you can use the x_ctrl array of real(dp) variables that is in &controls
      ! e.g., in the &controls inlist, you can set
      !     x_ctrl(1) = my_special_param
      ! then in your routine, you can access that by
      !     s% x_ctrl(1)
      ! of course before you can use s, you need to get it using the id argument.
      ! here's an example of how to do that -- add these lines at the start of your routine:
      !
      !         use star_lib, only: star_ptr
      !         type (star_info), pointer :: s
      !         call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
      !         if (ierr /= 0) then ! OOPS
      !            return
      !         end if
      !
      ! To get the binary pointer using the provided binary_id, add these lines.
      !     
      !      type (binary_info), pointer :: b
      !      call binary_ptr(binary_id, b, ierr)
      !      if (ierr /= 0) then ! failure in  binary_ptr
      !         return
      !      end if
      ! 
      ! for integer control values, you can use x_integer_ctrl
      ! for logical control values, you can use x_logical_ctrl

      contains
