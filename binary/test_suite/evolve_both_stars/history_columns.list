! history_columns.list -- determines the contents of star history logs
! you can use a non-standard version by setting history_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as history_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! blank lines and comments can be used freely.
! if a column name appears more than once in the list, only the first occurrence is used.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file
