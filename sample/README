You can put the sample directory anywhere and rename it as you wish.

Then do the following:

1) edit make/makefile to set MESA_DIR to the path to your mesa directory.

2) edit src/sample.f90 to set 'data_dir' to be the path to the mesa data directory.

3) run the 'mk' script to make.

4) run the 'rn' script to run.

5) run the 'ck' script to check that the code produces the expected results.
