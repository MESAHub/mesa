mesa includes a simplified version of STELLA. (thank you to Sergei Blinnikov and his group for making this possible)

it doesn't have all the newest features that are in the current research version of the code,
and there are lots of options that are not supported for use in the mesa version.
but it is still a very useful tool for creating light curves and ejecta velocities.

if you publish results that use stella, please reference the following papers in addition to mesa.

here's some background information.  see the MESA IV instrument paper for more details and many examples using MESA + STELLA.

   STELLA solves the radiative transfer equations in the intensity momentum approximation in each frequency bin. 
   In mesa, stella is typically run using 40 frequency groups, enough to produce spectral energy distribution, but not sufficient to produce spectra. 
   The opacity is computed based on over 153,000 spectral lines from Kurucz & Bell (1995) and Verner, Verner & Ferland (1996). 
   The expansion opacity formalism from Eastman & Pinto (1993) is used for line opacity taking the effect of high velocity gradients into account. 
   Opacity also includes photoionization, free–free absorption, and electron scattering. Local thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed in the plasma, 
   which allows the use of the Boltzmann–Saha distribution for ionization and level populations. STELLA does not include a nuclear network except 
   radioactive decay of nickel-56 to cobalt-56, and to iron-56. The code uses 16 species for calculating the overall opacity. 
   These are H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ar, Ca, a sum of stable Fe and radioactive 56Co, stable Ni and radioactive 56Ni. Energy from 
   nickel and cobalt radioactive decay is deposited into positrons and gamma-photons and is treated in a one-group transport approximation 
   according to Swartz, Sutherland & Harkness (1995).
   
   The 1D equations for mass, momentum, and total energy are solved using a Lagrangian comoving grid. The artificial viscosity 
   consists of the standard von Neumann artificial viscous pressure used for stabilizing solution (von Neumann & Richtmyer 1950) 
   and a so-called cold artificial viscosity used to smear shocks (Blinnikov et al. 1998). Therefore, STELLA allows one to properly 
   compute the propagation of the shock along the ejecta and the shock breakout event. The coupled equations of radiation hydrodynamics 
   are solved through an implicit high-order predictor–corrector procedure based on the methods of Brayton, Gustavson & Hatchel 
   (1972, see details in Blinnikov & Panov 1996; Stabrowski 1997).

Test Run


to do the standard test run, copy stella/test/mesa.abn and mesa.hyd to stella/modmake/

then just do the 'rn' script to compile and run.

each run of stella starts with a recompilation since model dependent parameters are needed at compile time.

after the compilations, several minutes are spent creating opacity tables specifically for the given model.

once the opacity tables are created, the actual stella run starts.
every 50 timesteps, a status line is output with time (days), surface v (kms), r (1e14 cm), and logL (ergs).
the run stops when the time reaches the value given in stella/strad/run/mesa.dat as "TcurB" (days).
You can edit TcurB as you wish before starting a run.  The default is 170.1 days.

The surface velocities will start out low but will rise rapidly at breakout.
Note that the times are given from the start of the run rather than from breakout.

Following is some terminal output from doing 'rn' for the standard test case input (from stella/test).
compare to your test run as a check before trying your own models.

note that the opacity tables are created using 6 parallel shell forks,
but stella itself uses a single thread, so there is no speed up for it on multicore machines.
depending on your processor, you should expect stella to take an hour or so to finish.

the results shown below will not exactly match your results since we have not converted stella
to use crlibm and follow the required standards we use in mesa to get bit-for-bit indentical
results across various platforms.  you can expect a close match, but even things like the
total number of steps and the final reported day can be expected to differ by small amounts.

Input 
      
   the 2 input data files are 
   
      mesa.hyd - information about the structure
         1st line: num zones, mass inner boundary, radius inner boundary, density at inner boundary
         following lines: 
            zone i, mass/Msun, r, density, temperature, velocity, pressure,
               0d0, energy, entropy, opacity, tau, v_div_csound
      mesa.abn - information about the composition
         each line:
            zone i, mass/Msun, dm/Msun, r, h1, he3+he4, c12, n14, o16, ne20, na23, mg24, 
               al27, si28, s32, ar36, ca40, fe52+54+56, skip, co56+ni56
         
      put the hyd and abn files in stella/modmake before doing ./rn

   create these in your mesa/star run by setting controls in &star_job.   
   for example,

      save_stella_data_when_terminate = .true.
      save_stella_data_filename = 'mesa'
      stella_show_headers = .false. ! must be false for files going to stella
         ! but can be true to make files for reference including text names of columns
      stella_min_surf_logRho = -100d0 ! prune surface cells in mesa model with density below this
      stella_min_velocity = 0d0 ! use this as the minimum initial velocity for cells mesa.hyd file.
      stella_skip_inner_dm = 0d0 ! skip this much of the mesa model for the stella files
      stella_skip_inner_v_limit = 1d5 ! skip inner cells in mesa model with v < this velocity (cm/s)
      stella_num_points = 400 ! total number of zones for stella files
      stella_nz_extra = 40 ! number of zones for CSM; set to 0 to skip having CSM added
      stella_mdot_years_for_wind = 1.2d0 ! these determine the CSM mass and size
      stella_mdot_for_wind = 0.30d0 ! Msun/year
      stella_v_wind = 12d0 ! km/s
   
      The total number of zones for stella files created by mesa/star are given by 'stella_num_points'.  
      The number of zones out of that total to be used for CSM is given by 'stella_nz_extra'.
      The value of stella_num_points must also be set in the file stella/obj/nfreq_and_mzone.inc.
   
      the mesa/star routine for creating stella files knows about the following species:
         h1, he3, he4, c12, n14, o16, ne20, na23, mg24, al27, si28,
         s32, ar36, ca40, ti44, cr48, cr60, fe52, fe54, fe56, co56, ni56
      if your net includes other species, they will be ignored when creating the stella file.
      on the other hand, any species missing from this list will simply be given 0 abundance.
      
      note that the optional CSM is specified in terms of a wind, but there is no
      actual assumptions about the source of the material.  the default density profile
      falls like 1/r^2 moving away from the surface.  if you would like to experiment
      with other kinds of mass halos, you are welcome to do so by doing your own processing
      to the model from mesa/star to construct mesa.hyd and mesa.abn input files for stella.
   
   
   For performance reasons, you may want to let the mesa run evolve the shock near enough
   to the surface than the stella model only uses a small fraction of the total number of zones 
   for unshocked material and the rest for the shocked section.
   That simply reduces the time stella will spend before shock breakout.
   However, it is important to have enough unshocked material that stella
   takes over the evolution before the light curve starts to climb,
   so be careful that you don't reduce the number of unshocked zones too far.
   
   There are many expert parameters for the stella run, but you should just use the defaults
   with a only few exceptions.
      
   Set TcurB, the stop time (in days) for the stella run, in stella/strad/run/mesa.dat
      There are differences between the stella internal time and the observer time.
      In most cases, this is not an issue. But for certain situations, 
      you may find that the output data stops at an earlier time than the end of the run.
      As easy work-around if this happens is simply to increase the TcurB value
      
   The list of times at the end of mesa.dat determines when stella adds to the output files.
   You can modify these times as desired.  If you add or remove any, update the total count in line 24.


-----------

Changing the number of frequency bins or the number of zones in model from center to surface

   The default number of frequency bins in mesa/stella is 40, and that should be fine for most jobs.
   The default number of zones is 400, which should also be enough for most jobs.
   
   If you'd like to change either number, then edit obj/nfreq_and_mzone.inc.
   The change will take effect the next time you recompile as part of a run.

Output


   output files are placed in the stella/res directory.  here are the ones you will most likely use.
   
      mesa.lbol_lnuc - col 1 is days post max Lbol, col 2 is log Lbol, col 3 is log Lnuc
      
      mesa.vel_feII - information about the FeII 5169 velocities.  columns are labeled.
         velocity at locations of various values for FeII 5169 tau Sobolev.
         
      mesa.swd.ph - information about conditions at the photosphere.  columns are labeled.
         radius, velocity, mass, T, rho, opacity, H, He, O, Fe, Lbol, and
         color magnitudes for UBVRI bands from mesa/colors based on stella values for Lbol, Teff, g, and Fe/H.

      mesa.day<N>_post_Lbol_max.data
         zone by zone profile of stella model at day <N> post max Lbol. Columns labeled. 
         Interpolated from profiles saved in mesa.swd, mesa.hyd, and mesa.abn

      mesa.tt — stella information about broad band light curves.
         initial section of file has information about the frequency bins.
         main section has labeled columns.
         The broadband magnitudes are given as MU, MB, MV, MI, and MR.
         Note that I and R are in reverse order for historical reasons.
         gdepos is gamma-ray deposition, i.e. the power of heating of all the
         mass on the hydro grid by gamma-rays from 56Ni-56Co decays in units 1e50 erg/s.
         Tbb and rbb are black body estimates, and Teff is a rough estimate for effective temperature.
         Rlast_sc is a rough estimate of last scattering radius. 
         the times in this file come from deep within stella and have not been readjusted to be relative to breakout.

         
   the times for saving output profiles in mesa.swd are set in the final section of the file stella/strad/run/mesa.dat.
      
      the default setting gives 76 profiles starting at day 2 and ending at day 173.
      you might want to adjust these to get more profiles saved around the end of the plateau for example.
      if the default settings show that the drop from the plateau happens around 110-120 days,
      then the default will only give information for days 110, 113, 116, and 120. Only integer values of days 
      are valid after day 1. To get profiles more often between 110 to 120, edit the list as desired,
      such as 110, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, and 120, and edit the total number of
      profiles given at the start of the list. in this case we've added 5 days, 
      so change 76 to 81.

   times for single output profiles as mesa.day<N>_post_Lbol_max.data are set in stella/res/stella_extras.f90 via 
   call statements such as 
      call save_day_post_Lbol_max(50d0,t0,zone,star_mass,mass_IB,'050')

Getting a "clean" stop during a run before the normal finish
   Every 10 steps, stella checks to see if there is a file named 'stop' in stella/strad/run.
   If it finds one, it acts as if it has reached the max number of allowed steps.
   This produces the normal output, whereas interrupting the run with CTRL-c would not.
   There is no way to restart a run that you have stopped.
