NOTE: the .fypp and .inc files are copied from the ForUM project
(https://github.com/rhdtownsend/forum). They are designed to be
processed using the fypp preprocessor
(https://github.com/aradi/fypp). Example fypp usage:

fypp kinds_m.fypp kinds_m.f90

Given that not all users will have fypp installed, for now we're
storing both .fypp/.inc *and* .f90 files in the repo. Longer term, we
may want to add fypp to the MESA SDK, allowing us to ship only the
.fypp/.inc files.

TL;DR: Don't edit the .f90 files, edit the .fypp/.inc files and run
fypp.
