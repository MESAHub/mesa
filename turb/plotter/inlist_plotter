  !### Ignore ierr so large ranges can be plotted (need to implement)
  ! ignore_ierr = .true.

  ! calculate over nR0 points in the range 1 < R0 < 1/tau
  nR0 = 50

  ! resolution used by FRG calculations
  spectral_resolution = 17 ! 9

  ! For FRG, we use 2*nks points in k space to scan for fastest growing mode
  nks = 50 ! 20

  ! whether or not to include T&C terms for extended matrix of FRG24 model
  FRG_withTC = .true.
  safety = 3  ! balance between accuracy and speed for FRG24 model, safety=0 is less accurate but faster, safety=3 (max) is accurate but slow

  !! Parameters for thermohaline calculations
  
  !! For RGB Stars
  tau = 1d-7
  Pr = 1d-6
  Pm = 0.1d0
  ! Magnetic field parameters (see HG19)
  HB1 = 1d-7 ! ~100 Gauss
  HB2 = 1d-5 ! ~1000 Gauss  
  
  !! For WDs
  ! tau = 1d-3
  ! Pr = 1d-3
  ! Pm = 1d0
  ! ! Magnetic field parameters (see HG19)
  ! HB1 = 1d-3 ! ~100 Gauss
  ! HB2 = 1d-1 ! ~1000 Gauss
