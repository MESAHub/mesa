These scripts help check MESA for common problems.

check_photos.py
---------------

This script makes sure that all of the values included in
``star_data_step_input.inc`` are saved in photos.


check_columns.py
----------------

This script checks that the history and profile code and the
``*_columns.list`` files are in sync. It can also check the column files
in the test_suite if enabled in the source code.

check_defaults.py
-----------------

This script checks that the controls and star_job defaults, the
``*_controls.inc``, and ``*_io.f90`` files are in sync. 

check_pgstar.py
----------------

This script checks that the inlist_pgstar files in the test_suite
have valid history/profile columns. Note it will have false postives for things only
defined in a run_star_extras.f90 and does not check non inlist_pgstar files
pgstar sections.


fix_underlines.py
-----------------

This script checks that the ~-level underlines in the defaults files
are the correct lengths and fixes any problems it finds.


mesa_linter.py
--------------

Checks fortran files for consistency with MESA's style guide.

Run over files and provide details of failures::

  python3 mesa-linter.py *.f90
	 
Provides only a count per file of the number of issues found::

  python3 mesa-linter.py -s *.f90

chek_test_suite_onwers.py
-------------------------

This script checks that each test suite case is listed in CODEOWNERS and
checks whether each test case has 0 owners (very bad) or just 1 owner
(less bad but should be fixed).

list_test_owner.py
------------------

Parses CODEOWNERS and prints the test cases owned by each person.

check_stop.py
-------------

Checks all .f90 files for stop 1 or stop 'string' and replaces them with a call
to mesa_error(__FILE__,__LINE__) . This way we can always find where an error
occurs rather than the non-unique stop 1 location.


check_empty_writes.py
---------------------

Checks all .f90 files for writes thats are both empty and unformatted (i.e write (*,*) ) (it also handles if the 
write is to a unit). Unformatted writes are non-portable and can cause issues with ifort.

check_omp_critical.py
---------------------

Checks all .f90 files for unamed critical blocks. When critical blocks are unnamed they acts as one block
thus each must be run seperatly. When critical blocks are named they can each be run in parrallel improving 
perfomance.


update_columns.py
-----------------

Copies the history and profile default columns file into each test case while preserving enabled
options in each test case


fix_inlists.py
--------------

Fixes various controls in the test_suite inlists that should not be enabled by default.
