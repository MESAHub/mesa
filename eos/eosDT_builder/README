edit Do_Test in make_plots


to specify whether radiation should be included, edit 'include_radiation.txt'
nonzero means yes, zero means no.
if you don't include radiation, the file prefix is changed from 'mesa'
to 'mesa-no-rad'


to test making files for a single z, edit 'whichz.txt' and then do ./ceos


to make the full set of files, do ./rn


to test running the eos with the new data, do ./local_export
and then edit the test code to have
   use_shared_data_dir = .false.

when you are ready to export the new data, first do ./build_eosDT_4_export
that will create the xz file in the eos directory

then run ./build_data_and_export for eos to install the new eos data in mesa/data
