Update:
Chabrier & Debras (2021), Paper 1, provided an update to the 
H EOS table which is intended only for use in blended tables 
(via cms_mixing below). They still recommend use of the 
original CMS 2019 H EOS, Paper 2, table when using a pure 
H EOS but when blending the new table should be used. The 
program cms_mixing has been slightly modified and the 
build_data script revamped to make this change.  The original
data directory DirEOS2019 has also been replaced with 
DirEOS2021. 

Original:
Notes on adapting the Chabrier et al. (2019) EOS tables to MESA.

The original data release is in the tarball "DirEOS2019.tar.gz".
                                replaced by "DirEOS2021.tar.gz"

There are two parts to building MESA tables with CMS:

1. cms_mixing does the entropy of mixing calculation, blending 
   pure-H and pure-He tables into composite tables. It also 
   converts the original units of CMS (MJ, kg, etc.) to cgs.
   The entropy of mixing calculation needs to be done on PT
   tables.

2. cms_resample starts with the output of cms_mixing, which is
   a series of PT tables for a range of X,Y values. This step
   resamples the PT tables into DT (Rho,T) tables and calculates
   additional quantities required by the MESA EOS.

Some things are not provided by CMS: mu, mu_e (ln_free_e), eta.

To re-run the tables, use the build_data script.
