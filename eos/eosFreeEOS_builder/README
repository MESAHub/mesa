The eosFreeEOS_builder creates EOS tables using the FreeEOS
code in the MESA/eos format.  If FreeEOS fails to provide
sane values, then the code takes values from MESA's eosDT_get.
If eosDT_get fails, then the code reverts to HELM.

FreeEOS is written by Alan Irwin and distributed under the GPL,
see ./free_eos-2.2.1/docs/COPYING. The version included here is
based on FreeEOS v2.2.1.

The controls for the program, free_eos_table, are set mostly in
the inlist file.  The X and Z values and filenames for different
tables are given as command line arguments. Run the program
without any arguments to see the structure of the arguments.

For example, running

     ./free_eos_table   0.02   0.70   mesa-FreeEOS_02z70x.data

produces a table with Z=0.02 and X=0.70.  All table files are
written to the data/ directory.

The mass fractions of Z for the 18 elements (other than H and He)
considered by FreeEOS should be set in the file pointed to by
mass_list in the inlist.  Any set of mass fractions for the
18 elements listed in these files should work but not all have
been tested.  Two examples are provided:

- mass_frac_solar.txt gives a solar abundance pattern

- mass_frac_CO.txt gives a 50/50 mix of carbon and oxygen
