History of the MESA Summer School Program
--------------------

The MESA Summer Schools have traditionally been held in Santa Barbara, California, until 2022. The 2023 MESA Summer School program, branded as MESA@Konkoly, was held in Budapest, Hungary. As of 2023, MESA Summer Schools can be run anywhere in the world. The involvement of the MESA developers is encouraged, and we are happy to help. 


How to run a MESA Summer School
--------------------

Preparing a good program takes about a year. Historically, the program has taken place in the middle of August. Assuming this timing, preparations for next year's program should begin in September.
