Overview of turb module

   :maxdepth: 1

The ``turb`` module provides routines for computing properties of turbulence
under local theories, including ``mlt`` (mixing-length theory), ``tdc`` (time-dependent convection),
semiconvection, and thermohaline turbulence.

Usage is by writing ``use turb`` at the top of a module or routine.
This imports the routines ``set_mlt``, ``set_tdc``, ``set_thermohaline``, and ``set_semiconvection``.
