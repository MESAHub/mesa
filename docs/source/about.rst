About MESA
==========

MESA was primarily developed through the concerted efforts of Bill
Paxton over a 10 year period with the engagement and deep involvement
of many theoretical and computational astrophysicists.  MESA is
currently developed and supported by a :ref:`globally distributed team
<about:The MESA Team>`.

Over the past decade, MESA has grown into an international community
resource.  The public availability of MESA has, and will continue,
to serve education, scientific research, and outreach.  We therefore
consider it important to re-express the guiding principles for using
and contributing to MESA.  Our goal is to assure the greatest
usefulness for the largest number of research and educational projects.

Motivation
==========

Stellar evolution calculations (i.e., stellar evolution tracks and
detailed information about the evolution of internal and global
properties) are a basic tool that enable a broad range of research in
astrophysics. Areas that critically depend on high-fidelity and modern
stellar evolution include asteroseismology, nuclear astrophysics,
stellar populations, chemical evolution and population synthesis,
astrobiology, binary stars, variable stars, supernovae, novae, compact
objects, tidal disruption events, stellar hydrodynamics, and stellar activity.

New observational capabilities are emerging in these fields that place
a high demand on exploration of stellar dependencies on mass,
metallicity and age. So, even though one dimensional stellar evolution
is a mature discipline, we continue to ask new questions of stars.
Some important aspects of stars are truly three-dimensional, such as
convection, rotation, and magnetism. These aspects remain in the realm
of research frontiers with evolving understanding and insights, quite
often profound. However, much remains to be gained scientifically (and
pedagogically) by accurate one-dimensional calculations, and this is
the focus of MESA.

Usage
=====

The MESA operating principles are simple: be open in your scientific
discussions, give credit to all contributors, and be prepared to give
back to the community of users.  We hope that this creates an
environment where the young are encouraged to become engaged in a
career-enhancing manner.

MESA is open-source and open-knowledge. It explicitly invites
participation from anybody (researchers, students, interested
amateurs). Participation in MESA can take a wide range of forms,
from using a MESA release for a science project, through testing and
debugging, to taking on responsibility for the continued stewardship.
The participation of experienced stellar evolution experts is welcomed.

Use of MESA requires:

1. That all publications and presentations (research, educational,
   or outreach) deriving from the use of MESA acknowledge the MESA
   instrument papers (Paxton et al. 
   `2011 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJS..192....3P/abstract>`_, 
   `2013 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJS..208....4P/abstract>`_, 
   `2015 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJS..220...15P/abstract>`_, 
   `2018 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJS..234...34P/abstract>`_, 
   `2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..243...10P/abstract>`_,
   Jermyn et al.
   `2023 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJS..265...15J/abstract>`_)

2. That users share in a timely fashion all information needed for others to
   recreate their MESA results (e.g., on `MESA Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa>`__).

3. That user modifications, additions, and tools are shared with the community.

4. That users agree to help others learn MESA, giving back as the project progresses.

The MESA Team
=============

The missions of the MESA Team are:

+ **Stewardship**: supporting contributors, maintaining the access
  and updates, seeking enabling funding, supporting MESA Summer Schools
  that allow for continued engagement, documenting MESA development in
  the refereed literature, and sustaining advanced development.

+ **Interface with the User Community**: answering questions from users,
  developing or accepting new code in an integrated fashion, supporting
  MESA workshops and events, maintaining a user registry, and identifying
  new MESA Team members from those most active and engaged in the
  intelligent use of MESA.

+ **Enable Scientific Research and Education**: promoting MESA and its
  goals, e.g., through scientific contributions at relevant conferences,
  identifying science opportunities that match MESA capabilities,
  facilitating and encouraging appropriate scientific collaborative
