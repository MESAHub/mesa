###############################################

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is an advanced, open-source 1D stellar evolution code.
The code is developed by a globally distributed team of researchers studying a range of stellar astrophysical phenomena.
MESA is written primarily in Fortran with a modular, flexible design that facilitates easy interfacing.
