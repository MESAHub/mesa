Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
###############################################

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is an advanced, open-source 1D stellar evolution code.
The code is developed and maintained by a globally distributed team of researchers.
MESA is written primarily in Fortran with a modular, flexible design that facilitates easy interfacing.

ðŸš€ New to MESA? Start with the :ref:`Quickstart<quickstart:Quickstart>` guide to set up and run your first models.

ðŸ“– Experienced users may find the :ref:`Reference and Defaults<reference:Reference and Defaults>` page most valuable for exploring the codeâ€™s features and input parameters. The :ref:`Test Suite<test_suite:Test Suite>` provides example problems for testing and showcasing MESA, serving as a project starting point but often requiring modifications for science-grade accuracy.
