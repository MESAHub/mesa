   ðŸ‘€ Looking for the `KU Leuven 2025 MESA Summer School page <https://mesa-leuven.4d-star.org/>`_?

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is an advanced, open-source 1D stellar evolution code.
The code is developed and maintained by a globally distributed team of researchers.
MESA is written primarily in Fortran with a modular, flexible design that facilitates easy interfacing.

ðŸš€ New to MESA? Start with the :ref:`Quickstart<quickstart:Quickstart>` guide to set up and run your first models.

ðŸ“– Experienced users may find the :ref:`Reference and Defaults<reference:Reference and Defaults>`
page most useful for exploring the codeâ€™s features and input parameters.
The :ref:`Test Suite<test_suite:Test Suite>` provides example problems for testing and showcasing MESA,
serving as a project starting point but often requiring modifications for science-grade accuracy.

Check out the full documentation below.
