Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
###############################################

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is an advanced, open-source 1D stellar evolution code.
The code is developed and maintained by a globally distributed team of researchers studying a range of stellar astrophysical phenomena.
MESA is written primarily in Fortran with a modular, flexible design that facilitates easy interfacing.

ðŸš€ New to MESA? Start with the :ref:`Quickstart<quickstart:Quickstart>` guide to set up and run your first models.

ðŸ“– Experienced users may find the :ref:`Reference and Defaults<reference:Reference and Defaults>` page most valuable for exploring the codeâ€™s features and input parameters. The :ref:`Test Suite<test_suite:Test Suite>` also describes a wide range of example problems that have been set up for testing and showcasing MESA's features. It can often be a starting point for beginning a project of your own but can require modifications to the setup (e.g. tighter tolerances, additional physics switched on) to be science-grade.
