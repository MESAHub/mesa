Overview
--------

MESA uses the atmosphere (atm) module to obtain a surface temperature
(T_surf) and surface pressure (P_surf), representing the conditions at
the base of the stellar atmosphere. These values are applied as
boundary conditions when evolving the interior model. (Aside: MESA
treats the atmosphere separately, via these boundary conditions,
because the physics governing the atmosphere is often quite different
from that in the interior).

Historically, MESA decided how T_surf and P_surf are calculated using
the 'which_atm_option' control. To improve consistency between the
atmosphere and interior calculations, and to offer more flexibility to
users, this control has been replaced by a new set of controls.



Choosing 'atm_option'
---------------------

The top-level control for determining how T_surf and P_surf are
calculated is 'atm_option'. Possible choices (and accompanying
controls) are as follows:

*) atm_option == 'T_tau'

  - MESA defines the temperature structure of the atmosphere using a
    T(tau) relation. The choice of relation is set by the
    'atm_T_tau_relation' control:

    *) atm_T_tau_relation == 'Eddington'

       -- use the Eddington grey relation.

    *) atm_T_tau_relation == 'solar_Hopf'

       -- use an approximate Hopf function calibrated against the Sun
          (see section A.5 of Paxton et al. 2013, MESA II). This is
          equivalent to the fit given by Sonoi et al. (2019, A&A, 621,
          84) to the Vernazza et al. (1981) VAL-C model.

    *) atm_T_tau_relation == 'Krishna_Swamy'

       -- use the approximate Hopf function given by Krishna-Swamy
          (1966, ApJ, 145, 174).
    
  - The pressure structure of the atmosphere is obtained by
    integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:

    dP/dtau = g/kappa

    ...for constant gravity g. There are three choices for how the
    opacity kappa is evaluated, set by the 'atm_T_tau_opacity'
    control:

    *) atm_T_tau_opacity == 'varying'

       -- at each optical depth, evaluate the opacity consistent with
          the local thermodynamic state (typically, density and
          temperature). This is done via calls to MESA's
          equation-of-state and opacity modules.

    *) atm_T_tau_opacity == 'fixed'

       -- assume the same opacity at each optical depth (i.e. uniform
          opacity), equal to the the opacity in the outermost cell of
          the interior model.

    *) atm_T_tau_opacity == 'iterated'
    
       -- assume the same opacity at each optical depth (again,
          uniform opacity), but use iteration to find an opacity
          consistent with the thermodynamic state at the base of the
          atmosphere.

  - For the 'varying' option above, the equation of hydrostatic
    equilibrium is integrated numerically. Controls that affect this
    integration include 'atm_T_tau_errtol' (sets the error tolerance)
    and 'atm_T_tau_max_steps' (sets the maximum number of steps).

  - For the 'iterated' option above, the equation of hydrostatic
    equilibrium is integrated analytically. Controls that affect the
    opacity iteration include 'atm_T_tau_errtol' (sets the error
    tolerance) and 'atm_T_tau_max_iters' (sets the maximum number of
    iterations).

  - For the 'fixed' option above, the equation of hydrostatic
    equilibrium is also be integrated analytically. No other controls
    are needed.

  - Once the temperature and pressure structure of the atmosphere is
    known, MESA evaluates T(tau) and P(tau) at tau=tau_surf, providing
    the necessary T_surf and P_surf values for the boundary
    conditions. The nominal surface optical depth tau_surf is
    calculated via

    tau_surf = tau_base * tau_factor

    Here, tau_base is the optical depth where T(tau) = Teff (the
    stellar effective temperature) for the chosen T(tau) relation,
    while tau_factor is a parameter determined from various controls
    in the &star_job namelist (e.g., 'set_tau_factor').

*) atm_option == 'table'

  - MESA uses pre-computed tables, from separate model atmosphere
    calculations, to interpolate T_surf and P_surf values for the
    boundary conditions. The interpolations are peformed using the
    effective temperature Teff and log10-surface gravity logg as
    independent variables. The choice of table is set by the
    'atm_table' control:

    *) atm_table == 'photosphere'

       - model atmosphere tables computed for a range of metallicites,
         using a combination of PHOENIX ((Hauschildt et al. 1999a,b)
         and Castelli & Kurucz (2003) treatments. Surface optical
         depth is defined so that T(tau_surf) = Teff.

    *) atm_table == 'tau_100'
       atm_table == 'tau_10'
       atm_table == 'tau_1'
       atm_table == 'tau_1m1'

       - model atmospheres computed for solar metallicites, using a
         combination of COND (Allard et al. 2001) and Castelli &
         Kurucz (2003) treatments. Surface optical depths are tau_surf
         = 100, 10, 1, 0.1, respectively.

    *) atm_table = 'WD_tau_25'

       - model atmospheres for cool white dwarfs, using Rohrmann et
         al. (2011, MNRAS, 411, 781) treatment. Surface optical depth
         is tau_surf = 25.12.

    *) atm_table = 'DB_tau_25'

       - model atmospheres for hot(ter) white dwarrfs, provided by Odette
         Toloza based on Detlev Koesterâ€™s atmosphere code. Surface
         optical depth is tau_surf = 25.12.

  - When any of these 'table' choices is used, it's possible that
    requested Teff and logg lies outside the table range. When this
    happens, MESA can optionally switch to an alternative approach for
    evaluating T_surf and P_surf. The alternative approach is
    determined by the 'atm_off_table_option' control, which can
    take the following values:

    *) atm_off_table_option == 'T_tau'

       - use the same T(tau) approach as described above for
         atm_option == 'T_tau'. The 'atm_T_tau_relation' and
         'atm_T_tau_opacity' controls (and others) are used in this
         case for the off-table evaluation.

    If 'atm_off_table_option' is left blank, an attempt to
    interpolate off the table will cause MESA to halt execution.

*) atm_option == 'irradiated_grey'

  - MESA defines the temperature structure of the atmosphere using a
    T(tau) relation based on the irradiated grey-atmosphere model of
    Guillot & Havel (2011, A&A 527, A20). The evaluation of this model
    depends on the 'atm_irradiated_T_eq' (equilibrium irradiation
    temperature), 'atm_irradiated_kap_v' and
    'atm_irradiated_kap_v_div_kap_th' (the latter two affecting how
    the irradiation opacity kap_v is set).

  - The pressure structure of the atmosphere is obtained by
    integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium:

    dP/dtau = g/kappa

    ...for constant gravity g. There are two choices for how the
    opacity kappa is evaluated, set by the 'atm_irradiated_opacity'
    control:

    *) atm_irradiated_opacity == 'fixed'

       -- assume the same opacity at each optical depth (i.e. uniform
          opacity), equal to the the opacity in the outermost cell of
          the interior model.

    *) atm_irradiated_opacity == 'iterated'
    
       -- assume the same opacity at each optical depth (again,
          uniform opacity), but use iteration to find an opacity
          consistent with the thermodynamic state at the base of the
          atmosphere. NOTE: currently, MESA can run into convergence
          problems when this option is used.

  - For the 'iterated' option above, the equation of hydrostatic
    equilibrium is integrated analytically. Controls that affect the
    opacity iteration include 'atm_irradiated_errtol' (sets the error
    tolerance) and 'atm_irradiated_max_iters' (sets the maximum number
    of iterations).

  - For the 'fixed' option above, the equation of hydrostatic
    equilibrium is also integrated analytically. No other controls are
    needed.

  - Once the temperature and pressure structure of the atmosphere is
    known, MESA evaluates T(tau) at tau=tau_surf, providing the
    necessary T_surf value for the boundary conditions. The nominal
    surface optical depth tau_surf is not set directly, but instead
    calculated from the 'atm_irradiated_P_surf' control:

    P(tau_surf) = atm_irradiated_P_surf

    (this also sets the value of P_surf for the boundary conditions).

*) atm_option == 'Paczynski_grey'

  - MESA creates an atmosphere using an approach inspired by Paczynski
    (1969, Acta Astr., vol. 19, 1). This is similar to using an
    Eddington-grey T(tau) relation, but includes corrections for
    geometric dilution at optical depth tau < 2/3, and also takes
    convection via MLT into account. Controls that affect the
    atmosphere calculation include 'Paczynski_atm_R_surf_errtol'.

*) atm_option == 'fixed_Teff'

  - MESA sets T_surf using the Eddington T(tau) relation, at an
    optical depth tau_surf (see the 'T_tau' section above for a
    discussion of how tau_surf is calculated). The effective
    temperature Teff is set by the 'atm_fixed_Teff' control.

  - MESA sets P_surf from the radiation pressure associated with
    T_surf.

*) atm_option == 'fixed_Tsurf'

  - MESA sets T_surf from the 'atm_fixed_Tsurf' control. The effective
    temperature is set using the Eddington T(tau) relation, at an
    optical depth tau_surf (see the 'T_tau' section above for a
    discussion of how tau_surf is calculated).

  - MESA sets P_surf from the radiation pressure associated with T_surf

*) atm_option == 'fixed_Psurf'

  - MESA sets P_surf from the 'atm_fixed_Psurf' control

  - MESA sets T_surf from the Eddington T(tau) relation, at an optical
    depth tau_surf (see the 'T_tau' section above for a discussion of
    how tau_surf is calculated). The effective temperature Teff is set
    by the stellar radius and luminosity.

*) atm_option == 'fixed_Psurf_and_Tsurf'

  - MESA sets P_surf and T_surf from the 'atm_fixed_Psurf' and
    'atm_fixed_Tsurf' controls, respectively.



Mapping from Old to New
-----------------------

For those wanting to convert existing inlists to use the new approach
described above, the following mappings may be useful:

Old: which_atm_option == 'simple_photosphere'
New: atm_option == 'T_tau'
     atm_T_tau_relation == 'Eddington'
     atm_T_tau_opacity = 'fixed'

Old: which_atm_option == 'grey_and_kap'
New: atm_option == 'T_tau'
     atm_T_tau_relation == 'Eddington'
     atm_T_tau_opacity = 'iterated'

Old: which_atm_option == 'Eddington_grey'
New: atm_option == 'T_tau'
     atm_T_tau_relation == 'Eddington'
     atm_T_tau_opacity = 'varying'

Old: which_atm_option == 'XXXXXX_tables' (various choices for XXXXXX)
New: atm_option == 'table'
     atm_table = 'XXXXXX'

Old: which_atm_option == 'grey_irradiated'
New: atm_option == 'irradiated_grey'
     atm_irradiated_opacity == 'fixed' (if atm_grey_irradiated_simple_kap_th = .true.)
     atm_irradiated_opacity == 'varying' (if atm_grey_irradiated_simple_kap_th = .false.)

If MESA is run using one of the old options, it will print out the
appropriate mapping and halt execution.



Atmosphere Structure Building
-----------------------------

MESA's atmosphere evaluation, described above, is primarily used to
get the T_surf and P_surf values for the boundary conditions. However,
when writing output files for pulsation codes (using the
'save_pulse_data...' controls), it is sometimes desirable to append
the (spatial) atmosphere structure data to the interior structure
data; that way, the extension of modes into the stellar atmosphere can
naturally be modeled by the pulsation code.

To append atmosphere structure data in this way, set the
'add_atmosphere_to_pulse_data' control to .true. . A couple of caveats
apply:

*) This capability is only available when atm_option == 'T_tau'
 or atm_option == 'Paczynski_grey'. For other choices of
 'atm_option' (e.g., 'table'), there are insufficient data to
 determine what the spatial structure of the atmosphere should be.

*) It's important to realize that calculation of atmosphere structure
 data has NO effect on the evolution of the star, OR on MESA's
 standard profile, history and photo outputs. Only the pulsation
 output files are affected.

When building atmosphere structure data, the following controls
influence how the calculation is performed:

*) 'atm_build_errtol' -- error tolerance for integrating the r(tau)
 [and possibly also T(tau)] equations

*) 'atm_build_dlogtau' -- maximum spacing in log10(tau) for
 atmosphere structure data

*) 'atm_build_tau_outer' -- outermost tau for atmosphere structure
 data (the data will extend from tau_surf to tau_outer)

The resulting structure data will contain approximately
[log10(tau_surf) - log10(tau_outer)]/dlogtau points.
