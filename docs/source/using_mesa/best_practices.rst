Best practices
==============

During the project
------------------

When you begin a new project you should generally use the most recent
MESA release. Unless you encounter bugs that negatively impact your
work, stick with that version throughout the project. If you’re starting
from a set of input files that were designed for an older version, we
suggest you invest some time porting it to the latest version, as if you
run into any issues this will make it much easier for the community to
assist you.

Before modifying any source code in the main MESA directory, check if
these changes cannot be applied locally in your work folder using the
:ref:`hooks provided by MESA <using_mesa/extending_mesa:Extending MESA>`. If you have a use
case that cannot be completed with the provided set of hooks, you can
always contact us to request a new one.

The MESA test suite (``star/test_suite`` and ``binary/test_suite``) is a
valuable source of examples and a good first stop when setting up a new
problem with MESA. Looking at the test suite inlists is a quick way to
familiarize yourself with the set of options relevant to your problem.
More information is available on :ref:`how to use a test suite case as a starting point for your own work directory <test_suite:Test suite>`.

You should always perform some sort of convergence study to ensure that
your results are not sensitive to the time or mass resolution of your
models.
Please note, and this is very important, that MESA defaults will
generally NOT be optimal or even acceptable for your particular science cases.
It is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the MESA options and controls
they choose are appropriate for the physics they want to study.
This will usually require appropriate testing and critical analysis of the models obtained.

Throughout your project, the best way to solicit community help and
input is via a message to the ``mesa-users@lists.mesastar.org`` mailing list.

In the paper
------------

You should provide a clear statement of which version of MESA was used
in the calculation. We also recommend noting which version of the MESA
SDK was used to compile MESA.

Citing MESA
^^^^^^^^^^^

You should cite all of the available MESA instrument papers at the time
of the MESA version being used, as MESA is sum of this work. Currently,
that is:

.. code-block:: latex

  Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
  \citep[MESA][]{Paxton2011, Paxton2013, Paxton2015, Paxton2018, Paxton2019}.


MESA critically rests on the hard work of many researchers who have
generated the input microphysics data that underpins the ``eos``,
``kap``, ``net``, and ``neu`` modules. We therefore encourage users to
briefly summarize these, including appropriate citations.

.. code-block:: latex

  The MESA EOS is a blend of the OPAL \citep{Rogers2002}, SCVH
  \citep{Saumon1995}, FreeEOS \citep{Irwin2004}, HELM \citep{Timmes2000},
  PC \citep{Potekhin2010}, and Skye \citep{Jermyn2021} EOSes.
  
  Radiative opacities are primarily from OPAL \citep{Iglesias1993,
  Iglesias1996}, with low-temperature data from \citet{Ferguson2005}
  and the high-temperature, Compton-scattering dominated regime by
  \citet{Poutanen2017}.  Electron conduction opacities are from
  \citet{Cassisi2007}.
  
  Nuclear reaction rates are from JINA REACLIB \citep{Cyburt2010} plus
  additional tabulated weak reaction rates \citet{Fuller1985, Oda1994,
  Langanke2000}.  Screening is included via the prescription of \citet{Chugunov2007}.
  Thermal neutrino loss rates are from \citet{Itoh1996}.


                
Note that this only summarizes the "default" capabilities, of the
currently released version of MESA. If you are making use of other
microphysics options, employing prescriptions such as wind mass loss
rates, or using older versions of MESA, please consult the documentation
for appropriate references.

In the the MESA binary module, by default:

.. code-block:: latex

   Roche lobe radii in binary systems are computed using the fit of
   \citet{Eggleton1983}.  Mass transfer rates in Roche lobe
   overflowing binary systems are determined following the
   prescription of \citet{Ritter1988}.



A :download:`BibTex file <mesa.bib>` with these references is available.

Citing included tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are making use of an instrument that is provided in MESA (e.g.,
ADIPLS, GYRE, RSP, or STELLA), please make sure to include citations to
the papers that describe it.

* ADIPLS ``\citep{ChristensenDalsgaard2008}``

* GYRE ``\citep{Townsend2013, Townsend2018}``

* RSP ``\citep{Smolec2008}``

* STELLA ``\citep{Blinnikov2004, Baklanov2005, Blinnikov2006}``

Citing the MESASDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The MESASDK can be cited via its Zenodo link `for
MacOS <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669543>`__ and `for
Linux <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669541>`__. Citations should also
contain the version of the MESASDK used, individual Zenodo DOI's are
available for each MESASDK version.

A :download:`BibTex file <tools.bib>` with these references is available.


Citing MESA Zenodo community contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are making use of material that has been shared by the `MESA
Zenodo community <https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa>`__, please make
sure to include citations to the Zenodo repository that you leveraged
and the science article(s) that describe the capability.

At the end of the project
-------------------------

You should make all information needed for others to recreate your MESA
results publicly available. This includes your inlists and
run_star_extras/run_binary_extras, the MESA version and the MESA SDK
version (or compiler version for non-SDK builds), as well as any
modifications to MESA that you may have made.

We recommend using `Zenodo <http://about.zenodo.org/>`__ for this
purpose. Zenodo assigns digital object identifiers (DOIs) for each
entry, providing an immutable way to reference an upload in a
publication. The service is also backed by the CERN data infrastructure,
ensuring the safety of data and its long-term availability. As Zenodo
allows uploads of up to 50GB, this gives the possibility to not only
share the input files, but also your simulation data products.

.. warning ::

    Beware that once an entry is published in Zenodo it cannot be
    removed, but new versions can be included if amendments are
    needed. While setting up an upload in Zenodo, or testing the service,
    you can make use of the `"sandbox" <https://sandbox.zenodo.org/>`__
    first. The "sandbox" allows you to see how a final entry would look
    before submitting the real thing to the main service.

We have a created a `Zenodo
community <https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa/>`__ with which you can
associate your Zenodo uploads. The `MESA
Marketplace <http://mesastar.org>`__ will remain in use as an aggregator
portal, and we request users to inform us of new uploads so that they
are highlighted there as well.
