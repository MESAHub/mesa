==============
Infrastructure
==============

This summarizes some of the external MESA infrastructure and who
controls it.

Assembla
--------

Our post-sourceforge SVN hosting was provided by Assembla.  Josiah
controls this account and negotiated with their sales team.  We will
not renew this account, so it will become inactive in mid-June 2021.
It cost $2000/yr, paid by Lars (through grants at KITP).


GitHub
------

We have the `MESAHub <https://github.com/MESAHub>`_ GitHub
organization.  The members of the MTC/MAC all have owner-level
privileges.  MESAHub is classified an educational organization and
this currently grants us a 100% discount, meaning this costs $0/yr.
Unsubsidized, it would cost about $1200/yr.

mesastar.org
------------

This is a long-standing domain name used by MESA.

Domain Name
^^^^^^^^^^^

Matteo controls the domain name (using domain.com) and handles
renewing it, updating nameservers, etc.

DNS Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The mesastar.org domain is configured to use Digital Ocean nameservers
and the DNS records are managed by Josiah.

Mailing lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mesa-users@lists.mesastar.org and
mesa-developers@lists.mesastar.org lists are hosted by `MailmanLists
<https://www.mailmanlists.net/>`_.  The account is controlled by
Josiah.  Frank has paid the hosting fees (through grants at ASU).
This costs about $100/year.

Marketplace
^^^^^^^^^^^

The address mesastar.org redirects to the `MESA marketplace
<http://cococubed.asu.edu/mesa_market/>`_, which is controlled and
hosted by Frank at ASU.


ReadTheDocs
-----------

The Sphinx documentation is hosted by `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_.  Rich controls the account.  This is
currently free for open source software.


Sourceforge
-----------

The original home of MESA development was sourceforge.  Most developers
involved c. 2015 or earlier have admin privileges.  This is a free
service.

Website
^^^^^^^

We still use the mesa.sourceforge.net website.  The source code for
this site lives at https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa-website and the
update process is managed by Josiah.


Slack
-----

Rich controls the Slack and pays for it (through grants at UW
Madison).  This costs ???/yr.


TestHub
-------

The MESA TestHub runs on Heroku and the account is controlled by Bill
Wolf.  Frank pays for this (through grants at ASU).  This costs ???/yr.


Zenodo
------

We have multiple resources archived on Zenodo.  This is a free service.

Community
^^^^^^^^^

The `MESA community <https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa/>`_ on Zenodo
is controled by Pablo.

* The `record for MESA releases <https://zenodo.org/record/4311514>`_ is controlled by Josiah.
