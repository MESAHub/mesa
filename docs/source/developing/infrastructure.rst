==============
Infrastructure
==============

This summarizes some of the external MESA infrastructure and who
controls it.

GitHub
------

We have the `MESAHub <https://github.com/MESAHub>`__ GitHub
organization.  The members of the MTC/MAC all have owner-level
privileges.  MESAHub is classified as an educational organization and
this currently grants us a 100% discount, meaning this costs $0/yr.
Unsubsidized, it would cost about $1200/yr.

mesastar.org
------------

This is a long-standing domain name used by MESA.

Domain Name
^^^^^^^^^^^

Matteo controls the domain name (using domain.com) and handles
renewing it, updating nameservers, etc.

DNS Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^

The mesastar.org domain is configured to use Digital Ocean nameservers
and the DNS records are managed by Josiah.

Mailing lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mesa-users@lists.mesastar.org and
mesa-developers@lists.mesastar.org lists are hosted by `MailmanLists
<https://www.mailmanlists.net/>`__.  The account is controlled by
Frank who pays the hosting fees (through grants at ASU).
This costs about $100/year.

New account signups are handled by Frank, Evan, and Rob.

Marketplace
^^^^^^^^^^^

The address mesastar.org redirects to the `MESA marketplace
<http://cococubed.asu.edu/mesa_market/>`__, which is controlled and
hosted by Frank at ASU.


ReadTheDocs
-----------

The Sphinx documentation is hosted by `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`__.  Rich controls the account (and Rob and Evan have access to it).  This is
currently free for open source software.


Sourceforge
-----------

The original home of MESA development was sourceforge.  Most developers
involved c. 2015 or earlier have admin privileges.  This is a free
service.

Website
^^^^^^^

We still use the mesa.sourceforge.net website domian name, but only for a top-level
redirect to docs.mesastar.org.

The source code for the old sourceforge site lives at https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa-website.

Slack
-----

Rich controls the Slack and pays for it (through grants at UW
Madison).  This costs around $130 per year (about $10/user/yr).


TestHub
-------

The MESA TestHub runs on Heroku and the account is controlled by Bill
Wolf.  It is funded by Frank and Bill W.  The Heroku account costs
around $600/yr, though its cost has been higher during the GitHub
transition.

The testing `log archive <https://logs.mesastar.org/>`__ lives on a
server controlled by Josiah.  The marginal cost is $1/month, which he
covers.

Jenkins
^^^^^^^

The Flatiron `Scientific Computing Core <https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/scientific-computing-core>`__
provides continuous integration testing for MESA via jenkins.
This was set up in 2021 by Dylan Simon (Flatiron) and Josiah.  The configuration lives in the ``jenkins`` directory.
Matteo serves as the point of contact at Flatiron.

Zenodo
------

We have multiple resources archived on Zenodo.  This is a free service.

Community
^^^^^^^^^

The `MESA community <https://zenodo.org/communities/mesa/>`__ on Zenodo
is controlled by Pablo.

Records
^^^^^^^

* The `record for MESA releases <https://zenodo.org/record/4311514>`__ is controlled by Pablo.
* The `record for OP Mono data <https://zenodo.org/record/4390522>`__ is controlled by Josiah.
* The records for MESA SDK releases (`macOS <https://zenodo.org/record/4638654>`__, `linux <https://zenodo.org/record/4638535>`__) are controlled by Pablo.
