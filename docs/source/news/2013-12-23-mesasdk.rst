====================
New MESA SDK Version
====================

:Date:   2013-12-23

It’s a Festivus miracle – with great pleasure I can announce the release
of a new MESA SDK! Version 20131223 is now available for 64-bit Linux
and OS X from the `SDK
website <http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesasdk>`__.
As usual, there’s no burning need to upgrade to this latest version; but
on the flip side, a number of important compiler issues have been fixed.
