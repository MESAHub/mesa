Revision 8845 has been designated a MESA release version.

The full release notes are available in `this mailing list
post <https://lists.mesastar.org/pipermail/mesa-users/2016-June/006691.html>`__.

-  In order to improve the clarity and uniformity of MESA inlist
   options, names using “cnt” were changed to use “interval” (e.g.,
   ``terminal_cnt`` was renamed to ``terminal_interval``). For the same
   reasons, the option ``photostep`` was renamed to ``photo_interval``.
   A simple find-and-replace will bring your inlists up-to-date. If one
   needs to make the changes in a more automated fashion, a sample
   migration script is included in the release announcement to
   mesa-users.

-  In the binary module, adjustments were made to the Eddington mass
   accretion rate to take into account black hole spins.
