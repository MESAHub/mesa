MESA-Web Updates
================

`MESA-Web <http://mesa-web.asu.edu>`__ is an online web interface for
MESA, which can be used for education and research purposes to calculate
stellar models.

Carl Fields and collaborators have announced `several
updates <http://sourceforge.net/p/mesa/mailman/message/34287767/>`__ to
MESA-Web since its release, including an `exciting
update <http://sourceforge.net/p/mesa/mailman/message/34439547/>`__ that
allows users to specify an RGB and AGB mass loss prescription and
efficiency. All runs also now include `a mp4
movie <http://sourceforge.net/p/mesa/mailman/message/34458630/>`__ of a
grid of diagrams constructed using your data. This grid will include an
abundance profile, HR diagram, and many more, making it easier than ever
to visualize your data!
