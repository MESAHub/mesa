====================
New MESA SDK Version
====================

:Date:   2014-03-13

Version 20140313 is now available for 64-bit Linux and OS X from the
`SDK
website <http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesasdk>`__.
The SDK reverted to old-style init scripts, as the new ones were causing
problems.
