Docker, Python and Web
======================

This week has seen three new/updated projects announced on mesa-users.

`Evan Bauer
announces <https://lists.mesastar.org/pipermail/mesa-users/2017-August/007853.html>`__
`MESA-Docker <https://github.com/evbauer/MESA-Docker>`__:

   *It’s a Docker container with MESA already installed, and it should
   work with any OS that supports Docker, including Windows 10.  This
   should serve as a useful tool for those who are ready to invest
   some extra effort to step beyond the limited options of MESA-Web,
   but not yet comfortable configuring their environment for full
   installation.*

`Rob Farmer
announces <https://lists.mesastar.org/pipermail/mesa-users/2017-August/007856.html>`__
`pyMesa <https://github.com/rjfarmer/pyMesa>`__:

   *This is a set of low level python bindings for MESA to allow easy
   access to the individual MESA modules.  This is aimed for those
   people who want to quickly get a result from a MESA module and
   don’t want to worry about getting fortran code compiled and
   working.*

`Carl Fields
announces <https://lists.mesastar.org/pipermail/mesa-users/2017-September/007864.html>`__
updates to `MESA-Web <http://mesa-web.asu.edu/>`__:

   1. *Users can now choose to upload a custom reaction rate.*
   2. *More mixing parameters available for calculations.*
   3. *Jobs now run for 4hrs or until iron core collapse.*
