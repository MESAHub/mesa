====================
New MESA SDK Version
====================

Version 20170802 is now available for 64-bit Linux and OS X from the
`SDK
website <http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesasdk>`__.

If you’re currently using the MESA SDK, there’s no immediate need to
upgrade; but the new SDK brings a few benefits:

-  The gdb debugger and valgrind memory checker are now included with
   the SDK.

-  The ffmpeg movie compiler is now back in the Mac OSX version of the
   SDK, along with the images_to_movie.sh script — these allow the
   straightforward creation of movies from sequences of images.
