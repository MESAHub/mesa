The 5th Annual MESA Summer School will be held August 15-19, 2016 at UC
Santa Barbara. Though extensive hands-on labs, participants will gain
familiarity with MESA and learn how to make better use of MESA in their
own work. Featured science topics include gravity-mode oscillations of
massive stars (Connie Aerts), transport by waves (Jim Fuller),
pulsations (Alfred Gautschy), massive stars (Norbert Langer), and much
more.
