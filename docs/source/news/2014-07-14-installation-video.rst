Jakub Ostrowski published a new `MESA installation tutorial on
YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce4arwugpA4>`__.

As he announced on mesa-users:

   I recorded the process of installing new version of MESA with some
   extended commentary. The vid is rather long but together with my
   `updated installation
   guide <http://cococubed.com/mesa_market/guides.html>`__ it could
   be helpful for some people.

You can see the full `announcement
here <http://sourceforge.net/p/mesa/mailman/message/32593947/>`__.
