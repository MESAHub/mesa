New MESA Website
================

:Date:   2014-03-21

The main MESA website has been updated, with the goal of making it
easier for new users to get started.

The new site also has somewhat less total content, with the aim of
making it easier for the developers to keep things up-to-date.

If you see errors or have suggestions for improvements, you can email
Josiah Schwab. Also feel free to open an issue or send a pull request on
`GitHub <https://github.com/jschwab/mesa-website>`__.

For the full annoucement, see `this mailing list
post <https://sourceforge.net/p/mesa/mailman/message/32133212/>`__.
