======================
MESA Release Zip files
======================

:Date:   2014-07-01

All current and past MESA releases are now available for `download from
sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mesa/files/releases/>`__ as
zip archives. A working Subversion installation is therefore no longer a
pre-requisite for MESA installation.

Future releases will also be offered as zip files (or in another
similiar archive format).
