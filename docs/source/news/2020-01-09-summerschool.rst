The 9th Annual MESA Summer School will be held August 10-14, 2020 at UC
Santa Barbara. Though extensive hands-on labs, participants will gain
familiarity with MESA and learn how to make better use of MESA in their
own research. Featured MESA topics include white dwarfs, massive star
binaries, non-linear pulsations, and more with Alejandra Romero, Ylva
GÃ¶tberg, and Radek Smolec.

Due date for applications is March 1, 2020:
