! history_columns.list -- determines the contents of star history logs
! you can use a non-standard version by setting history_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as history_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! blank lines and comments can be used freely.
! if a column name appears more than once in the list, only the first occurrence is used.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the log file contain parameter values as of the start of the run
! for completeness, those items are described here:

! initial_mass -- star mass at start of run (Msun units)
! initial_z -- starting metallicity
! h1_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for h1_boundary_mass
! he4_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for he4_boundary_mass
! burn_min1 -- 1st limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s
! burn_min2 -- 2nd limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file

! regions of strong nuclear burning

! 2 zones where eps_nuc > burn_min1 erg/g/s
! for each zone have 4 numbers: start1, start2, end2, end1
! start1 is mass of inner edge where first goes > burn_min1 (or -20 if none such)
! start2 is mass of inner edge where first zone reaches burn_min2 erg/g/sec (or -20 if none such)
! end2 is mass of outer edge where first zone drops back below burn_min2 erg/g/s
! end1 is mass of outer edge where first zone ends (i.e. eps_nuc < burn_min1)
! similar for the second zone

epsnuc_M_1 ! start1 for 1st zone
epsnuc_M_2 ! start2

! you might want to get a more complete list of mixing regions by using the following

!mixing_regions 40

!mixing_regions <integer> ! note: this includes regions where the mixing type is no_mixing.
! the <integer> is the number of regions to report
! there will be 2*<integer> columns for this in the log file, 2 for each region.
! the first column for a region gives the mixing type using the values defined in const_def
! the types are no_mixing, convective_mixing, overshoot_mixing, semiconvective_mixing,
! and salt_finger_mixing, numbered from 0 to 4.
! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid mixing_type value of -1.
! the second column for a region gives the m/mstar location of the top of the region
! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1
! all regions are include starting from the center, so the bottom of one region
! is the top of the previous one.  since we start at the center, the bottom of the 1st region is 0.

! the columns in the log file will have names like 'mix_type_1' and 'mix_qtop_1'


! misc

!v_div_csound_surf ! velocity divided by sound speed at outermost grid point
!surface_accel_div_grav ! (v - v_old)/dt divided by GM/R^2 at outermost grid point
