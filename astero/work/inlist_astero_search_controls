! null inlist to accompany default astero/work

! By default, this does nothing useful other than confirm that the
! astero module has built correctly and will run.  You probably want
! to copy inlists from another source, be that something you've set up
! before or the `example_astero` test case.

! For the sake of future readers of this file (yourself included),
! ONLY include the controls you are actually using.  DO NOT include
! all of the other controls that simply have their default values.

&astero_search_controls
   ! see star/astero/defaults/astero_search_controls.defaults
   ! for current set of controls and their default values.
