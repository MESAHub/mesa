Using GYRE within MESA
======================

GYRE is used internally by MESA's astero module to calculate stellar
eigenfrequencies; this capability is enabled by default, but can be disabled by
setting

WITH_GYRE = no

as an environment variable

Using GYRE Stand-alone
======================

GYRE can also be run in stand-alone mode, reading stellar models
produced by MESA (or other evolution codes) from file. Details on how
to do this are given at the website referenced above.

** IMPORTANT NOTE **

The full source code for the GYRE suite is provided in the build/gyre/src
subdirectory; there's no need to download it again from the
website. When following the instructions on the website, you should
set the GYRE_DIR environment variable to point to $MESA_DIR/build/gyre/src.

=============

Please direct all questions, comments, requests for support to the
GYRE forums, linked to on the website.
