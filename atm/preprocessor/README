Aaron Dotter - Mar 2010

This directory contains the files used to create to the model
atmosphere surface BC tables used by mesa/atm

The tables are constructed from three layers:
1. atmosphere integration using MESA/atm as a base layer
    -- this gives uniformity to the tables over the entire range of Z
    -- uses the MESA/atm module

2. Castelli & Kurucz 2003 model atmospheres evaluated at T = Teff
    -- Teff = 3500 - 50000 K, log(g) = 0 - 5, scaled solar Z
    -- based on data files from http://wwwuser.oat.ts.astro.it/castelli/

3. PHOENIX/NextGen model atmospheres evaluated at T =  Teff
    -- Teff = 2000 - 10000 K, log(g) = -0.5 - 5.5, scaled solar Z
    -- based on tables described by Dotter et al. (2007, AJ, 134, 376)

The tables are layered with preference for PHOENIX > C&K 2003 >
atmosphere integration. C&K 2003 model atmosphere structures are
provided for a range of Z, these are processed in Pgas(Teff,logg)
tables by the program ckread. See the source file for information
on running this program.

The MESA/atm tables are generated by create_table_atm, see the
source code for more information.

Final tables are created with table_merge. table_merge reads in
three tables, combines them, and writes out the final result.

For convenience, the input tables are provided in atm_input_data

atm_input_data/phx - PHOENIX tables
atm_input_data/ck03 - C&K 2003 tables and atmosphere structures
atm_input_data/atm - MESA/atm atmosphere integrations




The table summary files are hand-made.




NOTES FOR TAU 100

./make_tau100

check with plot_tau100.rb

if necessary, hand edit
   atm_data/100_Zp00_header.txt and
   table100_summary.txt

./cat_tau100

./local_export

cd ..; ./export_data

cd test
check src/plot_atm.f to make sure which_atm_option = atm_tau_100_tables
./cleanup;./mk;./pl
check plots with plot_atm.rb
