To use ADIPLS in its normal "stand-alone" mode,
follow the instructions in the mesa/adipls/adipack.c/README
Documentation can be found in adipack.c/notes.

If you have already installed mesa including adipls, 
then the things in adipack.c have been built and tested.
However, you will need to add a couple of lines to your startup
script.  These are needed for the command line operations
included in ADIPLS.   On my machine they look like this:

setenv PATH /Users/bpaxton/mesa/adipls/adipack.c/bin:$PATH
setenv aprgdir '/Users/bpaxton/mesa/adipls/adipack.c'



unpack adipls_tar_files/models.c.tar.gz 
try the following steps to check that things are working.

cd models
scan-amdl.d amdl.l5bi.d.15
redistrb.d redistrb.in
adipls.c.d adipls.c.in
freqdif.d freqdif.in
set-obs.d 16 l5bi.d.15.new.p2

The call to scan-amdl.d reads the model info in amdl.l5bi.d.15
and prints out some info such as that it has 2482 mesh points.

The call to redistrb.d reads its commands from redistrb.in;
this step can be skipped if you don't need to remesh the model
before doing the pulsation analysis.

The call to adipls.c.d reads its commands from adipls.c.in;
it writes out lots of info to the terminal as it searches for modes.

The call to freqdif.d reads its commands from freqdif.in;
it compares the newly created set of modes to a reference set.
The differences should all be small (they are in the last column).
For example, my last few rows look like this:

  431  431 1000 1000    2    2    4673.915    4673.915 -4.10535E-11
  432  432 1100 1100    0    0    3313.667    3313.667  1.20570E-13
  433  433 1100 1100    1    1    4128.076    4128.076 -3.66343E-11


The call to set-obs.d reads l5bi.d.15.new.p2 and write the mode info
to obs.l5bi.d.15.new.p2.  Open it and take a look.  It should start
with lines like these:

    0      1  258.0076  4.80998E-04  Data set from                           
    0      2  404.4800  9.91006E-05  grand summary in file                   
    0      3  535.9389  2.42835E-05  agsm.l5bi.d.15.new.p2                   
    0      4  680.5727  7.20557E-06  using (corrected) eigenfrequencies
