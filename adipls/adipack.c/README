Installation guide for adiabatic pulsations and models package
==============================================================

The package consists of five files:

this README file.

the file adipack.n.tar.Z

the file models.n.tar.Z

the file models.bin.n.tar.Z

the file models.for.n.tar.Z

As discussed in more detail below, either models.bin.n.tar.Z or
models.for.n.tar.Z should be used.

The installation consists in the following steps:

1) Transfer the relevant compressed tar files to the directory where you
   wish to place the code and models. Use the binary mode of ftp.
   Then, uncompress and un-tar them.

   To uncompress the files, type:
       uncompress adipack.n.tar
       uncompress models.n.tar
       etc.
   (NOTE: do NOT append the '.Z' to the filename for the command)

   To un-tar the files, type:
       tar xvf adipack.n.tar
       tar xvf models.n.tar
       etc.

   adipack.n.tar will generate the following directories:
   - adipls: contains basic pulsation code
   - adiajobs: contains auxiliary programs
   - bin: contains executables
   - gensr: contains general subroutines required by programs
   - idl_pro: contains IDL procedures for reading relevant data files
   - notes: contains plain TeX and postscript files of notes on the
     programs and data.

   models.n.tar will generate the following directory:
   - models: contains solar models in various forms, and input
     files for the programs.
   models.bin.n.tar or models.for.n.tar will add files to the
   models directory.

   Note that as the models directory is rather large
   (and could become quickly larger as the programs are run)
   it may be wise to store this directory on a different disk
   from the codes.

   In the following I refer to the directory where the unpack
   was performed as <root>. Also, reference to directories
   is often given relative to <root>.

2) It may be necessary to edit the makefile-s in the directories
   adipls, adiajobs, adiajobs/sr and gensr, to reset the
   name of the Fortran command and/or the flags for this command.
   The current command is "f77", with flag "-O2".

3) Compile and link the programs by the following steps:
   cd <root>/adipls   ; make
   cd <root>/adiajobs ; make

4) Add the directory <root>/bin to the command path
   (usually set in the .cshrc file).

5) Add the line
   set aprgdir = <root>
   in the .cshrc file (at a point where it is invoked every
   time a csh command is called).

6) Print the documentation in the directory notes, from the following
   files:
   - adiab_prog.tex (or adiab_prog.ps): notes on the adiabatic pulsation code
   - operation.tex (or operation.ps): more general notes on the programs
     and models provided
   - file-format.tex (or file-format.ps): notes on data structure for
     models in the form of an extensive set of variables, in
     an ASCII file (the so-called FGONG format).

7) If required, convert ASCII versions of binary data files
   (see below).

8) Go to the models directory and try to run the pulsation code,
   with the command
   adipls.n.d adipls.n.in

9) If this works, compare the locally computed frequencies with the
   the frequencies provided, by carrying out the command
   freqdif.d freqdif.in
   This command produces output on the screen and to the file
   dfr.4.l5bi.d.15.new-old. The differences should be very small.

10) At this point you are ready to start using the package.
   Please send me an E-mail (to jcd@obs.aau.dk) indicating
   that you have installed the package, and providing your
   E-mail (and other) addresses, as well as a few details on
   the system on which the package is being run. This will
   enable me to notify you of bugs or updates.

Notes on file formats:
----------------------

The programmes generally operate with binary input and output files.
The binary format evidently may vary between installations.
The binary distribution file (models.bin.n.tar.Z) uses a format
valid on, e.g., SGI and SUN installations; this should probably
be preferred in these cases, as providing the full double-precision accuracy.
However, for use on installations with different binary formats
I also include the distribution file models.for.n.tar.Z,
which contains the same data, but converted to ASCII form with
the commands form-amdl.d and form-agsm.d (also provided).

The ASCII versions of the files are named by adding ".for" to the
binary-file name.

To convert the model files from ASCII to binary, use, e.g., the command

  form-amdl.d 2 amdl.l5bi.d.15.p2.for amdl.l5bi.d.15.p2

Similarly, to convert the ASCII version of the grand summary file of
oscillation results, use, e.g.,

  form-agsm.d 2 agsm.l5bi.d.15.p2.for agsm.l5bi.d.15.p2

(note that this also provides a list of the modes in the file).

To allow a test of consistency of the binary format, I have included
the model file amdl.l5bi.d.15 in the models.n.tar.Z distribution file.
Try to run the command

  scan-amdl.d amdl.l5bi.d.15

on this file; if the result looks reasonable, your binary format is
probably consistent with mine.

Compiler warnings:
------------------

It is possible that compilation will produce warnings on some systems.
These should generally be unimportant. A particular cause of warnings
is the fact that I often dimension arrays passed as arguments into
subroutines as, e.g.,

      dimension a(1)

in the subroutine, even if the true dimension of the array is bigger than one.
This will cause a warning if the compiler attempts a check of array bounds.
I have yet to come across a system where this causes problems.
Please let me know if you suspect that it is a problem in the
results of computations on your system.

Disclaimer:
-----------

There is no guarantee that the package will work as intended,
although it has been used previously, in a less well-documented
form, by several people. I am willing to consider problems,
or suggestions for improvements, but given my schedule I cannot
promise to act quickly on them.

I shall attempt to correct errors in the package, as they are pointed
out to me, and post revised versions. This file (and the Web pages)
will contain a record of such updates, with a few details of the
problems that have been fixed. Below is a list of problems that
have been seen of different installations, but appear to be
of a sufficiently special nature that they should not be corrected
in the general release: my inclination would be to leave features
that are convenient on most machines, even if they cause problems
in selected cases.

Acknowledgements:
-----------------

I am very grateful to Alan Irwin and Helmut Schlattl for their help
in testing this version of the package, as well as to Frank Hill for
tests of the previous release.

Known potential problems:
-------------------------

On IBM RS6000, AIX4.1 operating system, and some Linux systems:

  In gensr/ofiles.f, line 168: The option disp='delete' is apparently
    not allowed. (The purpose is to create a scratch file that is
    deleted at the end of the run.) The simple fix is to remove
    the disp, and delete the file by hand.

On HP-UX:

  In adipls/sigout.n.d.f, lines 312, 320, 327: The flush command
  is apparently not known. (It empties the output buffer after
  each write of results to file.) The statement can simply be deleted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on modifications:
-----------------------

26/4/99: Fixed a number of minor problems. These were mainly related
	 to unset variables, at points in the programmes which would
	 rarely be used. I am grateful to Ladislav Zejda for pointing these out.
	 The following files were affected:
         - adipls/adipls.n.d.f
         - adipls/nrtssl.d.f
         - adipls/nrkm.d.f
         - adipls/sigout.n.d.f
         - gensr/vintk.new.d.f
         - adiajobs/fdif.sin.d.f

11/7/00: Fixed two minor problems in adiajobs/redistrb.d.f which caused
	 problems for Chia-Hsien Lin on a Linux installation.

18/10/00: Fixed problem in adipls/sigscn.n.d.f which caused erroneous
	  setting of limit of evanescent region in scan for sig.

6/1/04:  Established directory ./gensr_linux which contains files for Linux
         installation. Before installation this should be moved to .gensr.
	 Currently the only differing routine is ofiles.f

Notes on comments (for possible modifications):
-----------------------------------------------

26/8/99: To allow use under shells other than csh, may need to add
	 #!/bin/csh
	 as first line in scripts. See earn/f.rsamadi.990820.
