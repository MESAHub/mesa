C   This subroutine computes a set of parameters defining a
C C2 (twice continuously differentiable) bivariate function
C C(X,Y) which interpolates data values F at a set of N
C arbitrarily distributed points (X,Y) in the plane (nodes).
C The interpolant C may be evaluated at an arbitrary point
C by function CS2VAL, and its first partial derivatives are
C computed by Subroutine CS2GRD.
C
C   The interpolation scheme is a modified Cubic Shepard
C method:
C
C C = [W(1)*C(1)+W(2)*C(2)+..+W(N)*C(N)]/[W(1)+W(2)+..+W(N)]
C
C for bivariate functions W(k) and C(k).  The nodal func-
C tions are given by
C
C  C(k)(x,y) = A(1,k)*(x-X(k))**3 +
C              A(2,k)*(x-X(k))**2*(y-Y(k)) +
C              A(3,k)*(x-X(k))*(y-Y(k))**2 +
C              A(4,k)*(y-Y(k))**3 + A(5,k)*(x-X(k))**2 +
C              A(6,k)*(x-X(k))*(y-Y(k)) + A(7,k)*(y-Y(k))**2
C              + A(8,k)*(x-X(k)) + A(9,k)*(y-Y(k)) + F(k) .
C
C Thus, C(k) is a cubic function which interpolates the data
C value at node k.  Its coefficients A(,k) are obtained by a
C weighted least squares fit to the closest NC data points
C with weights similar to W(k).  Note that the radius of
C influence for the least squares fit is fixed for each k,
C but varies with k.
C
C The weights are taken to be
C
C   W(k)(x,y) = ( (R(k)-D(k))+ / R(k)*D(k) )**3 ,
C
C where (R(k)-D(k))+ = 0 if R(k) < D(k), and D(k)(x,y) is
C the Euclidean distance between (x,y) and (X(k),Y(k)).  The
C radius of influence R(k) varies with k and is chosen so
C that NW nodes are within the radius.  Note that W(k) is
C not defined at node (X(k),Y(k)), but C(x,y) has limit F(k)
C as (x,y) approaches (X(k),Y(k)).
C
C On input:
C
C       N = Number of nodes and data values.  N .GE. 10.
C
C       X,Y = Arrays of length N containing the Cartesian
C             coordinates of the nodes.
C
C       F = Array of length N containing the data values
C           in one-to-one correspondence with the nodes.
C
C       NC = Number of data points to be used in the least
C            squares fit for coefficients defining the nodal
C            functions C(k).  Values found to be optimal for
C            test data sets ranged from 11 to 25.  A recom-
C            mended value for general data sets is NC = 17.
C            For nodes lying on (or close to) a rectangular
C            grid, the recommended value is NC = 11.  In any
C            case, NC must be in the range 9 to Min(40,N-1).
C
C       NW = Number of nodes within (and defining) the radii
C            of influence R(k) which enter into the weights
C            W(k).  For N sufficiently large, a recommended
C            value is NW = 30.  In general, NW should be
C            about 1.5*NC.  1 .LE. NW .LE. Min(40,N-1).
C
C       NR = Number of rows and columns in the cell grid de-
C            fined in Subroutine STORE2_sg.  A rectangle con-
C            taining the nodes is partitioned into cells in
C            order to increase search efficiency.  NR =
C            Sqrt(N/3) is recommended.  NR .GE. 1.

C               with cells.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2_sg.
C
C       LNEXT = Array of length N containing next-node
C               indexes.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2_sg.

C                         dimensions.  Refer to Subroutine
C                         STORE2_sg.
C
C       RMAX = Largest element in RW -- maximum radius R(k).
C
C       RW = Array containing the the radii R(k) which enter
C            into the weights W(k).
C
C       A = 9 by N array containing the coefficients for
C           cubic nodal function C(k) in column k.
C
C   Note that the output parameters described above are not
C defined unless IER = 0.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = 1 if N, NC, NW, or NR is outside its
C                     valid range.
C             IER = 2 if duplicate nodes were encountered.
C             IER = 3 if all nodes are collinear.

C   This subroutine computes the value, gradient, and
C Hessian at P = (PX,PY) of the interpolatory function C
C defined in Subroutine CSHEP2.  C is a weighted sum of
C cubic nodal functions.
C
C On input:
C
C       PX,PY = Cartesian coordinates of the point P at

C               to be evaluated.

C
C       LCELL = NR by NR array of nodal indexes associated
C               with cells.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2_sg.
C
C       LNEXT = Array of length N containing next-node
C               indexes.  Refer to Subroutine STORE2_sg.
C
C       XMIN,YMIN,DX,DY = Minimum nodal coordinates and cell
C                         dimensions.  DX and DY must be
C                         positive.  Refer to Subroutine
C                         STORE2_sg.
C
C       RMAX = Largest element in RW -- maximum radius R(k).
C
C       RW = Array of length N containing the the radii R(k)
C            which enter into the weights W(k) defining C.
C
C       A = 9 by N array containing the coefficients for
C           cubic nodal function C(k) in column k.
C
C   Input parameters are not altered by this subroutine.
C The parameters other than PX and PY should be input
C unaltered from their values on output from CSHEP2.  This
C subroutine should not be called if a nonzero error flag
C was returned by CSHEP2.
C
C On output:
C
C       C = Value of C at (PX,PY) unless IER .EQ. 1, in
C           which case no values are returned.
C
C       CX,CY = First partial derivatives of C at (PX,PY)
C               unless IER .EQ. 1.
C
C       CXX,CXY,CYY = Second partial derivatives of C at
C                     (PX,PY) unless IER .EQ. 1.
C
C       IER = Error indicator:
C             IER = 0 if no errors were encountered.
C             IER = 1 if N, NR, DX, DY or RMAX is invalid.
C             IER = 2 if no errors were encountered but
C                     (PX,PY) is not within the radius R(k)
C                     for any node k (and thus C = 0).

C   Given a set of N nodes and the data structure defined in
C Subroutine STORE2_sg, this subroutine uses the cell method to
C find the closest unmarked node NP to a specified point P.
C NP is then marked by setting LNEXT(NP) to -LNEXT(NP).  (A
C node is marked if and only if the corresponding LNEXT element
C is negative.  The absolute values of LNEXT elements,
C however, must be preserved.)  Thus, the closest M nodes to
C P may be determined by a sequence of M calls to this rou-
C tine.  Note that if the nearest neighbor to node K is to
C be determined (PX = X(K) and PY = Y(K)), then K should be
C marked before the call to this routine.
C
C   The search is begun in the cell containing (or closest
C to) P and proceeds outward in rectangular layers until all
C cells which contain points within distance R of P have
C been searched, where R is the distance from P to the first
C unmarked node encountered (infinite if no unmarked nodes
C are present).

C of the same name in QSHEP2D.
