============

MESA welcomes contributions from the user community.  Please note that
contributing code to MESA (e.g., acceptance of a pull request) does
not entitle one to co-authorship of a MESA instrument paper.

Proposed changes will be carefully reviewed by the MESA developers.
Simple bugfixes or improvements to documentation are likely to be
readily accepted.  Modifications that can be easily realized via hooks
may be more appropriate for `mesa-contrib <https://github.com/MESAHub/mesa-contrib>`__.

We strongly recommend against undertaking any significant development
effort without first emailing mesa-developers@lists.mesastar.org with
an outline of your anticipated changes.

New contributions must be proposed through GitHub's *pull request*
(PR) system.  The process is roughly:

1. fork the ``mesa`` repo (click *Fork* in the top-right of the GitHub interface),
2. clone your fork to your computer,
3. create a new branch for your additions (e.g. ``git switch -c my-new-hook``),
4. make, commit and push your changes and
5. open a PR against the ``main`` branch.

Once the PR is opened, the developers will review your code and make a
decision about whether to merge it into the repo, perhaps after some
changes are made.
