! profile_columns.list -- determines the contents of star model profiles
! you can use a non-standard version by setting profile_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as profile_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the profile contain general info about the model.
! for completeness, those items are described at the end of this file.


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file


! the following lines of the profile contain info for 1 zone per row, surface to center.
