!mixing_regions 40
!burning_regions 80



! you might want to get a more complete list of mixing regions by using the following

!mixing_regions 40

!mixing_regions <integer> ! note: this includes regions where the mixing type is no_mixing.
! the <integer> is the number of regions to report
! there will be 2*<integer> columns for this in the log file, 2 for each region.
! the first column for a region gives the mixing type using the values defined in const_def
! the types are no_mixing, convective_mixing, overshoot_mixing, semiconvective_mixing,
! and salt_finger_mixing, numbered from 0 to 4.
! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid mixing_type value of -1.
! the second column for a region gives the m/mstar location of the top of the region
! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1
! all regions are include starting from the center, so the bottom of one region
! is the top of the previous one.  since we start at the center, the bottom of the 1st region is 0.

! the columns in the log file will have names like 'mix_type_1' and 'mix_qtop_1'
