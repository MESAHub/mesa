! MESA4 Figure 50
   ! 4 pulses before core collapse
   ! 1st 2 remove H env, 2nd 2 remove most of He env.
   ! 1st when mass = 87.1, He core = 45.6, CO core = 41.1
   ! final mass 41.2
   ! 1st 2 separated by 2.2 days
   ! ringdown after 1st 1.8 hours.
   ! then almost a year before the next.

!historical note   
!   ppisn in 9967 "worked" (like MESA4 Fig 50)
!   used Riemann hydro
!   did not use op_split_burn (no one used it back then)
!   but still finished with log_rel_run_E_err -2
!   did not include Pablo's later changes to relax model after mass ejection
!   just ripped off the outer shells and changed the outer BC to match
!   
!dev_pre_ms_to_cc_pair_instability is my attempt to reproduce the 9967 ppisn
