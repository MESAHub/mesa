******************

Test suite cases should have a ``README.rst`` file that contains a
brief description of the test and its purpose.

If possible, articulate the criteria that indicate a passing test and
include information that would allow someone else to evaluate the test
status.  Supplementary material like plots, plotting scripts, etc.,
should go in a subdirectory ``docs``.

For tests that are likely to serve as examples of MESA usage, provide
additional information about key options or important caveats.  This
assists users who are adapting the test case to their own science.

The README file should end with a line that describes when the most
recent significant changes to this test case occurred.  This gives
both users and developers a sense of how "fresh" the information is.
