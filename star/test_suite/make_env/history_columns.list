! history_columns.list -- determines the contents of star history logs
! you can use a non-standard version by setting history_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as history_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! blank lines and comments can be used freely.
! if a column name appears more than once in the list, only the first occurrence is used.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the log file contain parameter values as of the start of the run
! for completeness, those items are described here:
   
   ! initial_mass -- star mass at start of run (Msun units)
   ! initial_z -- starting metallicity
   ! h1_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for h1_boundary_mass 
   ! he4_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for he4_boundary_mass
   ! burn_min1 -- 1st limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s
   ! burn_min2 -- 2nd limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file

         ! the <integer> is the number of regions to report
         ! there will be 2*<integer> columns for this in the log file, 2 for each region.

         ! the types are no_mixing, convective_mixing, overshoot_mixing, semiconvective_mixing,
         ! and salt_finger_mixing, numbered from 0 to 4.

         ! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid mixing_type value of -1.
         ! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1

      ! start2 is mass of inner edge where first zone reaches burn_min2 erg/g/sec (or -20 if none such)
      ! end2 is mass of outer edge where first zone drops back below burn_min2 erg/g/s
      ! end1 is mass of outer edge where first zone ends (i.e. eps_nuc < burn_min1)
      ! similar for the second zone
   
      epsnuc_M_1 ! start1 for 1st zone
      epsnuc_M_2 ! start2

            ! where val = ergs/gm/sec nuclear energy minus all neutrino losses.
         ! the second column for a region gives the m/mstar location of the top of the region
         ! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid value of -9999
         ! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1
