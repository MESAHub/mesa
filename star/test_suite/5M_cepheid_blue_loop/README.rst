********************
5M_cepheid_blue_loop
********************

This test case checks that the evolution of a 5 Msun, metal-poor Z=0.008, helium-enriched Y=0.256 model
executes a blue-loop in the HR diagram and crosses the classical Cepheid instability strip boundaries three times.

This test case has two parts. Click to see a larger view of a plot.

* Part 1 (``inlist_start``) creates a pre-main sequence model and evolves it to the onset of core helium burning, just past the tip of the Red Giant branch.

* Part 2 (``inlist_cepheid_blue_loop``) continues the evolution as core helium burning proceeds. The model executes a blue loop, with the red edge and blue edge of the classical Cepheid instability strip boundaries shown in the HR diagram:
