nothing special in run_star_extras; all done using simple-to-understand standard controls

Z = 1.6d-3; rotation and wind off for these runs
to avoid problems with H/He ionization zones, keep surface cell at high temperature by setting tau_surface = 1d6
semiconvection and thermohaline on during H and He core burning, off after that
no overshooting; MLT++ on; use_gold2_tolerances on; op_split_burn for cells with logT > 9.0

the pgstar plots have lots of useful information for understanding the progress to core collapse.
