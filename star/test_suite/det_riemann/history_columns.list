      model_number ! counting from the start of the run
      star_age ! elapsed simulated time in years since the start of the run
      star_mass ! in Msun units
      !star_mdot ! d(star_mass)/dt (in msolar per year)
      !time_step ! timestep in years since previous model
      log_dt ! log10 time_step
      num_zones ! number of zones in the model
   
   ! mixing regions
   
      !  mx1 refers to the largest (by mass) convective region.
      !  mx2 is the 2nd largest.

      !  conv_mx1_top and conv_mx1_bot are the region where mixing_type == convective_mixing.
      !  mx1_top and mx1_bot are the extent of all kinds of mixing, convective and other.

   ! regions of strong nuclear burning
   
      ! 2 zones where eps_nuc > burn_min1 erg/g/s
      ! for each zone have 4 numbers: start1, start2, end2, end1
      ! start1 is mass of inner edge where first goes > burn_min1 (or -20 if none such)
      ! start2 is mass of inner edge where first zone reaches burn_min2 erg/g/sec (or -20 if none such)
      ! end2 is mass of outer edge where first zone drops back below burn_min2 erg/g/s
      ! end1 is mass of outer edge where first zone ends (i.e. eps_nuc < burn_min1)
      ! similar for the second zone
   
      epsnuc_M_1 ! start1 for 1st zone
