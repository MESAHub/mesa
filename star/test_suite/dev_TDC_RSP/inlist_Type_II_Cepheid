! type-II Cepheid of BL Her type  0.55Ms, 136Ls, 6410K, X=0.76, Z=0.0001
! convective parameters are such, that it should show deterministic chaos
! - lots of struggling between low and high amplitudes. 
! Growth rates are high, so only after ~20-40 cycles the attractor is approached. 
! A model motivated by: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.441..101S.
! You can increase the alfa_m (eddy viscosity) to e.g. 0.25. Then it should pulsate regularly.

! original test case contributed by Radek Smolec.
