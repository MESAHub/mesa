! Candidate for a double-mode delta Scuti variable:
! 2 Msol star leaving the main-sequence phase through
! the upper part of the S-bend on its HR track.
! Both F (0.171 d) and O1 (0.127 d) modes are linearly overstable  
! with very small growth rates (of the order of 10**-5).
! It takes more than 10**4 star-days for the pulsations to saturate. 
! 
! original test case contributed by Alfred Gautschy.
