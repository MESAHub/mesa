! for cases in which you have a run that has reached steady pulses
! and you want to look at plots of just a few periods to see the details,
! i suggest the following method. interrupt the run soon after
! it makes a photo.  remove or delete LOGS/history.data to force
! creation of a new one when restart.  edit the inlist to set
! history_interval to 1 to get maximum time resolution.
! restart the run and let it go for as many periods as desired.
