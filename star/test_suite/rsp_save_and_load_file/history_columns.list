! log_columns.list -- determines the contents of star history logs
! you can use a non-standard version by setting log_columns_file in your inlist

! units are cgs unless otherwise noted.

! reorder the following names as desired to reorder columns.
! comment out the name to omit a column (fewer columns => less IO => faster running).
! remove '!' to restore a column.

! if you have a situation where you want a non-standard set of columns,
! make a copy of this file, edit as desired, and give the new filename in your inlist
! as log_columns_file.   if you are just adding columns, you can 'include' this file,
! and just list the additions in your file.   note: to include the standard default
! version, use include '' -- the 0 length string means include the default file.

! blank lines and comments can be used freely.
! if a column name appears more than once in the list, only the first occurrence is used.

! if you need to have something added to the list of options, let me know....


! the first few lines of the log file contain parameter values as of the start of the run
! for completeness, those items are described here:
   
   ! initial_mass -- star mass at start of run (Msun units)
   ! initial_z -- starting metallicity
   ! h1_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for h1_boundary_mass 
   ! he4_boundary_limit -- defines abundance limit for he4_boundary_mass
   ! burn_min1 -- 1st limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s
   ! burn_min2 -- 2nd limit for reported burning, in erg/g/s


! note: you can include another list by doing
!        include 'filename'
!        include '' means include the default standard list file

      ! you might want to get a more complete list of mixing regions by using the following
      
      !mixing_regions 40
      
      !mixing_regions <integer> ! note: this includes regions where the mixing type is no_mixing.
         ! the <integer> is the number of regions to report
         ! there will be 2*<integer> columns for this in the log file, 2 for each region.
         ! the first column for a region gives the mixing type using the values defined in const_def
         ! the types are no_mixing, convective_mixing, overshoot_mixing, semiconvective_mixing,
         ! and salt_finger_mixing, numbered from 0 to 4.
         ! entries for extra columns after the last region in the star will have an invalid mixing_type value of -1.
         ! the second column for a region gives the m/mstar location of the top of the region
         ! mstar is the total mass of the star, so these locations range from 0 to 1
         ! all regions are include starting from the center, so the bottom of one region
         ! is the top of the previous one.  since we start at the center, the bottom of the 1st region is 0.
