*******************************

This test case checks the implementation of the extended convective penetration prescription for core boundary mixing.

This test case has 2 parts. Click to see a larger view of a plot.

* Part 1 (``inlist_zams``) builds a 5.0 Msun, Z=0.02 metallicity, pre-main sequence model and evolves it to the main sequence.

* Part 2 (``inlist_extended_convective_penetration``) continues the evolution until the hydrogen mass fraction drops below 0.4 Msun. The mixing types and temperature gradients are then checked at 4 points in the model:

where the number in the second column is the value from running the test case,
the number in the second column is the allowed lower bound, and
the number in the second column is the allowed upper bound.

At 0.8 Msun, we expect to be inside the convective core, and hence to have convective mixing with an adiabatic temperature gradient
(:math:`\nabla_T = \nabla_{ad}`). 

At 0.95 Msun, we should be in the convective penetrative part of the core boundary mixing region. 
So we expect the mixing type to be overshoot, and the temperature gradient to be adiabatic. Here, we also check if the mixing coefficient 
equals the one at the convective boundary, to check if the coefficient behaves step-like in this region. 

At 1.1 Msun, we expect to be in the exponentially decaying overshoot region, where the temperature gradient is making a gradual switch between 
the radiative and adiabatic gradients, :math:`\nabla_T = f\nabla_{ad} + (1-f)\nabla_{rad}`, with :math:`f` the fraction of the
temperature gradient that is adiabatic. Here, we also check that the fraction :math:`f` deviates from 1 and 0, so that :math:`\nabla_T`
is actually making a gradual switch, and that the mixing coefficient is between 1e4 cm :sup:`2`/s and 1% 
of the mixing at the core boundary, to confirm that it is decaying.

At 1.5 Msun, we should be outside the convective core and overshoot region, so that the mixing type is minimum diffusive mixing and that 
we have a radiative temperature gradient (:math:`\nabla_T = \nabla_{rad}`).
