This test case evolves a very massive helium star from the He-ZAMS
up to the occurrence of a pulsational pair-instability event (see |Marchant2019|).

.. |Marchant2019| replace:: `Marchant et al. 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...882...36M/abstract>`__

Initialization of the model
===========================
The initial mass of the helium star is set in ``inlist_extra``

.. literalinclude:: ../../../star/test_suite/ppisn/inlist_extra

In this case we use a :math:`72 M_\odot`
