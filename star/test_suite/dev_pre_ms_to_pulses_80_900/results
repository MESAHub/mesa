and to MESA4 (2018), Fig 49.

cases
A     several weak pulses leading to core collapse
B     strong pulses leading to stop for ejecta logR = 4 before core collapse
C     direct collapse to BH with no ejecta

even if final total energy > 0, takes time to get the ejecta accelerated so that v > v_esc.
the initial ejecta can reach logR = 4 long before the last of the "remnant" is "ejected".

M_ejecta    surface region with v > v_escape
v_ejecta    approximate velocity range of ejecta


nothing special in run_star_extras; all done using simple-to-understand standard controls

the pgstar plots have lots of useful information for understanding the progress to core collapse.

Z = 1.6d-3; rotation off for these runs; wind during H and He core burning (Dutch_scaling_factor = 0.5d0), off after that
to avoid problems with H/He ionization zones, keep surface cell at high temperature by setting tau_surface = 1d7
semiconvection and thermohaline on during H and He core burning, off after that
no overshooting; MLT++ on
remove H envelope after finish core He burning; change remaining traces of H1 to He4
use_gold2_tolerances on (except during remove envelope)
op_split_burn for cells with logT > 9.0
after end of core C burn, change to Riemann hydro and hybrid amr mesh to prepare for strong shocks
also, now turn off convection for cells with T > 1d9 to avoid violating mlt assumptions during rapid changes in core
prepare for start of pulses by evolving until reach target max temp (logTmax = 9.52) or start non_fe_core_infall (> 300 kms)
consider mass to be "ejected" when it and all above it have v > local v_esc.
stop run when fe_core_infall > 100 kms, logR > 4.0, or remnant mass < 10M.
for simplicity, keep ejected mass as part of the model rather than removing it.
can follow cases to completion that end in core collapse or complete unbinding.
intermediate cases have such long times between pulses that the ejecta must be removed for the run to continue.
that is beyond the scope of this test but is the subject of the ppisn case.
