M_He     mass of final He core
M_CO     mass of final CO core
M_Fe     mass of final Fe core

nothing special in run_star_extras other than alpha_mlt_routine and option for running GYRE
all done using simple-to-understand standard controls

Z = 0.02; rotation and wind off for these runs
semiconvection, thermohaline, and overshooting on during H and He core burning, off after that
use_gold2_tolerances on; alpha_mlt on; op_split_burn for cells with logT > 9.0

the pgstar plots have lots of useful information for understanding the progress to core collapse.

at end, optional inlist_prepare_for_ccsn_IIp turns on Riemann hydro and switches to amr mesh
the final model from that can be used as starting model for ccsn_IIp test
