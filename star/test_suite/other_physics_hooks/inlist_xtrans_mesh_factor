&xtrans_mesh_factor


!### xtra_coef_above_xtrans
!### xtra_coef_below_xtrans

! Multiply `mesh_delta_coeff` near any change in most abundant species by this factor.
! Value < 1 gives increased resolution.

xtra_coef_above_xtrans = 1d0
xtra_coef_below_xtrans = 1d0


!### xtra_dist_above_xtrans
!### xtra_dist_below_xtrans

! Increase resolution up to this distance away from the abundance transition
! with distance measured in units of the pressure scale height at the boundary.

xtra_dist_above_xtrans = 0.2d0
xtra_dist_below_xtrans = 0.2d0
