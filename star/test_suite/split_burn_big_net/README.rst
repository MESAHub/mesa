split_burn_big_net
******************

This test suite example checks the use of MESA's split burn capabilites in a 25 |Msun| star, during silicon burning

Physical checks
===============

This test case tracks the total number of burner sub-steps taken in the final timestep.


Inlists
=======

This test case has one part. 


* Part 1 (``inlist_big_net``) loads a model and runs it for 10 timesteps.

* Part 1 (``inlist_common``) provides a number of useful options when evolving massive stars to core collapse.
