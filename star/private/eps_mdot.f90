      !! Delta(dm_j) = F_{j} - F_{j+1}.

         !!! High-level explanation

         ! This subroutine calculates the maximum fractional change in entropy that thermal
         ! leakage can produce. When this is zero all changes in state must be adiabatic.
         ! When this is one there is enough time for arbitrarily large changes in entropy.

         ! The derivation is as follows.
         ! The perturbation to the luminosity L of a fluid element due to a perturbation
         ! in its specific entropy S follows dL/L ~ d(grad S)/grad S. In radiative zones this
         ! is ~dS/S. In convective zones it's ~ dS / (S * grad_r_sub_grad_ad).
         ! Because grad_r_sub_grad_ad is of order unity in radiative zones we can use this correction everywhere.
         ! The takes to leak out is therefore dm * TdS/dL ~ dm * grad_r_sub_grad_ad * TS/L, where dm is the mass of the element.
         ! This is the thermal time-scale of the fluid element. By comparison, in time dm*dt/mass_flux the
         ! element will no longer be in the same cell, so while in this cell a fraction L*dt/(TS mass_flux)
         ! of this perturbation can leak out. The fraction which leaks out cannot exceed one, and so
         ! we obtain the expression below. Note that we approximate TS by the specific thermal energy Cp*T.

         !!! High-level explanation

         ! When the thermal time-scale is long, material changes adiabatically as it descends.
         ! When the thermal time-scale is short, material bleeds entropy along the way.
         ! The adjust_mass routine assumes that we are in the latter limit and so produces a state
         ! which assumes entropy has been lost along the way.
         ! If this is correct, we should count up the entropy lost in each cell and use that to set eps_mdot.
         ! If this is not correct, we should instead follow parcels of material as they descend, track
         ! the entropy they were (incorrectly) assumed to have lost, and restore it via eps_mdot.
         ! We connect these limits using the leak fraction, as defined in set_leak_frac.

         ! The calculation of what energy to restore and what to leak is done in the leak subroutine.
         ! This (leak_control) subroutine precomputes some useful quantities for that calculation and
         ! then divides the star into contiguous blocks within which the mass flows monotonically
         ! up (surface-ward) or down (center-ward). It then calls leak on each such block.

            ! Should never happen, because we bail out earlier if mdot == 0.
            ! Nevertheless the logic that follows should work without issue.
            ! We just need to set delta_m to be something non-zero for the purposes
            ! of this subroutine because -delta_m is used to normalize the pass fraction.
            ! That is ALL it is used to do in this routine however, and the normalization
            ! is arbitrary (we just choose to use delta_m for convenience) so we can set it
            ! to anything we like.

         ! The leak fraction determines the fraction of any attempted entropy

         ! excess is the amount of heat the material has which it would deposit
         ! if given the time.

         ! passes through cell i we find

         !
         ! That is, we first calculate the entropy change associated with moving the material
         ! through the next cell (heat picked up). We then add that to the current excess.
         ! A fraction leak_frac of the cumulative entropy excess is then deposited as heat and
         ! decremented from the excess.
         ! When the material reaches whatever cell it ends in (i == j) the excess is deposited
         ! in that cell. If material exits the star the excess it leaves with is accounted for
         ! in mdot_adiabatic_surface.
