      ! We assume dm1 and dm2 have the same length nz.
      ! We allow the indices j and k to range between 0 and nz-1
      ! inclusive. Here m(nz) is just the mass of the centre.

      ! min(m1(j), m2(k)) - max(m1(j+1), m2(k+1))

      ! We first compute the differences between the arguments of each
      ! min and max to determine the final difference.

      ! There are nz*nz combinations of (j,k), but only <= 2*nz of them
      ! are non-zero. To see this assume  withouut loss of generality that
      ! m1(1) < m2(1). Augment m1 with m1(0) = m2(1). It follows that the
      ! overlap (0,1) is non-zero, as is the overlap (nz,nz). Because
      ! mass is monotonic, the (j,k) with non-zero overlaps form a sequence
      ! which is monotonic in both j and k. There are at most 2*nz points in
      ! such a sequence. To avoid allocating a quadratic amount of memory in nz
      ! we therefore store just 2*nz overlaps. The locations of these overlaps are
      ! given by j == ranges(:,1), k == ranges(:,2). Some of these j's or k's
      ! will generally be zero, corresponding to the padding described above.
