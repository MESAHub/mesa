! mass corrections
! ================


! use_mass_corrections
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! Gravitational vs baryonic mass corrections.

! The Lagrangian coordinate (:math:`m`) in MESA is the baryonic
! mass and the density (:math:`\rho`) is the baryonic mass
! density.

! If false, then no distinction between gravitational and baryonic mass.
! If true, then the gravitational mass is calculated using mass corrections
! and the momentum equation, total energy equation, and Brunt are modified.

! The variable ``mass_correction`` is the quantity you multiply
! the baryonic mass density by to get the gravitational mass
! density:

!     (mass density) = (baryon density) * amu * mass_correction

! Given the mass fractions in a cell, the value of
! mass_correction is provided by the ``chem`` module.

! MESA holds m_grav fixed during the newton iterations.  This results
! in an energy conservation error, because the specific potential energy
! changes when m_grav is updated afterwards.  A message showing
! the relative energy error incurred due to this assumption
! will be printed to the terminal.

! Not compatible with RSP.

! ::

use_mass_corrections = .false.


! WD phase separation
! ===================

! do_phase_separation
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! Phase separation upon crystallization in WD cores
! (currently only for C/O white dwarf cores)
! using the phase diagram of `Blouin et al. 2021 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PhRvE.103d3204B>`_.

! ::

do_phase_separation = .false.

! do_phase_separation_heating
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! if true, calculate heating term associated with changes in
! internal energy due to any abundance changes from phase
! separation, and include this term in the energy equation.

! ::

do_phase_separation_heating = .true.

! phase_separation_mixing_use_brunt
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! if true, the phase separation mixing recalculates relevant
! EOS quantities and evaluates the Ledoux criterion,
! including the brunt B term that depends on the composition
! gradient. This can be somewhat expensive, so this option can
! be set to false to instead just mix outward until there is
! no more negative mu gradient. These will produce similar
! final chemical profiles, but setting this option to true
! is the only way to properly evaluate the physical criterion.

! ::

phase_separation_mixing_use_brunt = .true.

! phase_separation_no_diffusion
! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

! if true and element diffusion is on, prevent element diffusion
! from occurring in the layers where phase separation mixing
! is present (experimental)

! ::

phase_separation_no_diffusion = .false.
