inlist_which determines what test to run

copy one of these to inlist_which to pick the one that you want

   inlist_BEP
   inlist_BLAP
   inlist_Cepheid
   inlist_Delta_Scuti
   inlist_RR_Lyrae
   inlist_Type_II_Cepheid
   
the starting models come from the respective rsp test cases run for about 50 steps before saving.

to create new test cases, use rsp to create the starting model, then create a new inlist_* to match.

the inlists have been adjusted to force a timestep a bit less that would be "standard" for rsp.
this lets both TDC and RSP to keep in synch by having the same timesteps.

both runs save photos at the same interval.  
to restart, edit inlist_multi_stars_job to set restart_flag = .true. and set restart_names.

to change the pgstar profiles for debugging,
   edit corresponding code in rsp and tdc to save info in xtra arrays.
   edit run_star_extras data_for_extra_profile_columns to set names and values for the xtra arrays.
   edit inlist_common Profile_Panels1_yaxis and Profile_Panels1_other_yaxis names to match the new debugging output.
      can just move the Profile_Panels1 section "debugging output" to after the section "standard output".

for example, to track a problem in Source
   in hydro_tdc, compute_Source, add these at end
      s% xtra1_array(k) = Source%val
      s% xtra2_array(k) = PII_face_00%val
      s% xtra3_array(k) = Hp_face_00%val
      s% xtra4_array(k) = PII_face_p1%val
      s% xtra5_array(k) = Hp_face_p1%val
      s% xtra6_array(k) = fac%val
   in rsp_step, calc_source_sink, add these corresponding lines
      s% xtra1_array(k) = s% SOURCE(k)
      s% xtra2_array(k) = s% PII(k)
      s% xtra3_array(k) = s% Hp_face(k)
      s% xtra4_array(k) = s% PII(k+1)
      s% xtra5_array(k) = s% Hp_face(k+1)
      s% xtra6_array(k) = POM2*POM3
   in star/test, do mkx to remake and export star with your changes
   in inlist_common, move the "debugging output" section to after the "standard output"
   in run_star_extras, data_for_extra_profile_columns, change .false. to .true. in 2 places.
   the profile plots will show xtr* for TDC and xtr*_R for RSP values.
   that's ok for typical use, but if you want to change them, just edit the inlist and run_star_extras.
   
   for super-fine-grain comparisons, try using the "debugging xtra ratios" option in run_star_extras.
   or add new things as you wish.
