! Compute atomic diffusion coefficients.
! The input parameters are 
! rho          density [gcm^-3]
! T            temperature [K]
! m            number of elements  
! A            mass [amu], note element NN is electrons
! charge       charge [e]
! na           number density [cm^-3]  
! The output are the resistance coefficients in Burgers equations K_ij, z_ij, z'_ij and z''_ij
! It is also possible to output diffusion coefficients D_ij and thermal diffusion coeffcient
!     A_th used in Cowling&Chapman formalism, note Ath(m,i) is Ath_ei
      
      
      
! NOTE: the number of classes of isos = m-1; m is for electrons
! for j from 1 to m-1, you can get the chem id for class j by
!        cid = chem_get_iso_id(s% diffusion_class_representative(j))
! e.g., if the representative for class j is he4, then cid will = ihe4 (defined in chem_def)
