      module neu_lib
      ! library for calculating neutrino losses from non-nuclear-burning sources
      ! neutrino losses that occur during nuclear reactions are included in the nuclear library
      ! the data interface for the library is defined in neu_def

      use const_def, only: dp

      implicit none


      contains ! the procedure interface for the library
      ! client programs should only call these routines.


      subroutine neu_get(T, log10_T, Rho, log10_Rho, abar, zbar, log10_Tlim, flags, &
               loss, sources, info)
         use neu_def
         use mod_neu, only : neutrinos

         ! this routine computes neutrino losses from the analytic fits of
         ! itoh et al. apjs 102, 411, 1996, and also returns their derivatives.

         ! provide T or log10_T or both (the code needs both, so pass 'em if you've got 'em!)
         ! same for Rho and log10_Rho

         real(dp), intent(in) :: T ! temperature
         real(dp), intent(in) :: log10_T ! log10 of temperature
         real(dp), intent(in) :: Rho ! density
         real(dp), intent(in) :: log10_Rho ! log10 of density
         real(dp), intent(in) :: abar ! mean atomic weight
         real(dp), intent(in) :: zbar ! mean charge
         real(dp), intent(in) :: log10_Tlim
         ! log10 of temperature at which begin to cutoff results
         !    NOTE: the Itoh et al data has a lower temperature limit of 10^7
         !    so for T < 10^7, the neutrino losses are simply set to 0
         !    Rather than have an abrupt cutoff, the values are multiplied by a coefficient
         !    that reaches 0 at T = 10^7 and is equal to 1 for log10T > log10_Tlim
         ! log10_Tlim of 7.5 is a reasonable choice.
         logical, intent(in) :: flags(num_neu_types) ! true if should include the type of loss

         integer, intent(out) :: info ! 0 means AOK.
